      "Title and text of article": "Sydney live music venue embraces grant for soundproofing amid noise complaint concerns When the Red Rattler theatre in Marrickville installed acoustic foam in the walls behind its stage, it did not just make the venue soundproof — but future-proof.\n\nIn Sydney's inner west, where noise complaints can sometimes become the final nail in the coffin for a struggling venue, it pays to be prepared.\n\n\"Even though they've put new laws in … I know that there's always that one person or that one thing, there's always a loophole,\" the venue's senior program manager, Kween G said.\n\nNew laws toughened the process around noise complaints in NSW as of last year.\n\nAmong the changes, disputes against a premises will favour the party who occupied the area first, to stop residents restricting the offerings of already-established venues.\n\nKween G says soundproofing has been a game changer for this inner west live music venue. (ABC News: Berge Breiland)\n\nOnce construction began on apartments in the streets behind the Red Rattler, it became even more crucial to ensure the building, which once sat in a primarily industrial area, could continue hosting live shows.\n\nThe theatre is among several venues given state government funding to install soundproofing as part of a grant program launched in 2024.\n\nKween G said once the work was completed, the noise complaints largely dried up, and the quality of performances inside the converted warehouse space improved dramatically.\n\n\"I often stand at the back of the room and go, 'Wow, it sounds really good in here',\" she said.\n\n\" It sounds crisp, it's clear, it's made a massive difference. \"\n\nThe state government's grant program has been expanded this year — giving venues across NSW a share of $5.1 million for soundproofing, equipment upgrades and professional advice.\n\nThe Red Rattler in Marrickville is taking advantage of the grants from the NSW government. (ABC News: Berge Breiland)\n\nMinister for Music and the Night-time Economy John Graham said the program was aimed at keeping the NSW music scene alive.\n\n\"Over a decade of [lockout laws] followed by the COVID lockdowns, we lost a lot of music venues … we're determined to keep the ones we've got,\" he said.\n\nMr Graham said the initiative has been well-received by locals who live nearby.\n\n\" It means a quiet night's sleep near the venue, and a good night out inside the venue. \"\n\nJohn Graham, pictured next to Kween G, says the aim of the grants is to keep the music scene alive. (ABC News: Berge Breiland)\n\nThe Red Rattler also used its funding to install new air-conditioning, sound equipment and DJ software.\n\nKween G said the work cost close to $250,000 in total — and they would not have been able to afford it themselves.\n\n\"We would have to ask for donations, we would be calling out for people to help us to raise the money.\n\n\"Like, you'd go, 'Are you going to pay the mortgage or are you going to fix the air quality?'\"\n\nVenues across NSW embrace future-proof funding\n\nIn total, 39 venues across the state are receiving funding under the program — including nearby Enmore Theatre also in the inner west, Elton Chong in Penrith and The Servo in Port Kembla.\n\nUnderground bar Club 77 in Sydney's Darlinghurst is spending its grant money on accessible upgrades including a lift, disabled toilets and a wheelchair-friendly DJ box.\n\nTim Blunt, who fronts Sydney-based band FVNERAL, said having the right facilities can make or break an act.\n\nTim Blunt says audiences are hyperaware of quality sound technology in live music venues. (ABC News: Berge Breiland)\n\n\"There's nothing more distracting when you're trying to play a show than the sound being bad and clearly recognising that the audience is aware that the sound is not as good as it should be,\" they said.\n\nAdd to your watchlist Photo shows Mystery Road Origin ABC iview with young detective Jay Swan in the bush.

(BBC Proms: Chris Christodoulou)\n\nA native of Santander, a historic port city in Spain, Martín fell in love with classical music as a child. He charted a path from being a professional flute player to becoming one of Europe's leading orchestral conductors.\n\nHe officially took up the reins as chief conductor of the MSO in 2022.\n\nSince establishing himself in Melbourne, Martín has championed prominent Australian composers, including figures such as pioneer Margaret Sutherland and First Nations trailblazer Deborah Cheetham Fraillon.\n\nWe spoke with Martín just before the start of the tour, where he shared the significance of the MSO's long-awaited visit to his hometown.\n\nTaking an Australian symphony orchestra home\n\nMartín grew up in Santander, on the northern coast of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nUnlike Melbourne and other Australian capital cities, the town didn't have a resident symphony orchestra when Martín was growing up. But since 1952, Santander has hosted a month-long international festival of music and dance every summer.\n\n\"I was not interested in music until my father took me to a concert at the Santander International Festival when I was eight,\" Martín shares.\n\n\" I loved it so much, the next day I [told] my parents I would like to learn to play an instrument. \"\n\nMartín heard Mussorgsky's Pictures At An Exhibition during that fateful first concert.\n\nDecades later, after making a career in the music world, including a stint as director of the Santander International Festival between 2012-2020, Martín performed the same piece of music with the MSO at the festival where it all began.\n\n\"[This time] instead of being an eight-year-old boy looking at the stage with my father, I was conducting,\" Martín says.\n\nIt was a remarkable moment for the audiences at Santander, with an orchestra from the other side of the world making a debut performance with one of their own \"son of this land.\" They gave a standing ovation.\n\nGuide to Listening: BBC Proms on ABC Classic Photo shows Close up of Anja Bihlmaier conducting the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall. Your guide to listening to the BBC Proms on ABC Classic through September.\n\nAnother milestone for the orchestra during the tour was their appearance at the BBC Proms in London's Royal Albert Hall.\n\nIt's rare for an Australian orchestra to perform at the world's biggest classical music festival and only the second time the MSO has performed there. They made their Proms debut in 2014.\n\nMartín curated a program including Haunted Hills by Australian Composer Margaret Sutherland, Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto with soloist Khatia Buniatishvili, and Dvořák's Sixth Symphony.\n\nThe performance of the Sutherland was interrupted by pro-Palestine protesters, and the orchestra restarted the music from the top.\n\n\"The London performance was the culmination of the MSO's successful tour of Europe,\" says a spokesperson for the orchestra. \"We are so proud of the MSO's artistry and professionalism. They delivered world-class performances and artistic excellence to sold-out audiences across the UK and Europe.\"\n\nHuge trucks and chartered flights\n\nThere were more than 100 people on this international tour, Martín says.\n\nThe orchestra started in Edinburgh, which might just be one of the longest trips from Australia.\n\nAlthough most musicians are seasoned travellers, the journey is still quite an undertaking especially for big instrument players like cellos, double bases and timpani.\n\nOnce they were in Europe, the orchestra hired huge trucks and chartered flights to get all of those musicians and instruments between cities.\n\nWorking out the logistics of a tour like this takes a lot of organisations from a lot of people, Martín says.\n\nA year before the tour, the orchestra sent a team over to scout details like how to get from the hotels to the performance venues, where the stage doors are, even where to get coffee during breaks.\n\n\"It's a big operation, but it's how it is in the world of orchestra touring,\" Martín says.\n\nThe orchestra travelled across Europe: from Edinburgh to Santander, Südtirol in Italy, Hamburg in Germany and then back to London. They performed to mostly sold-out audiences.\n\nSharing Australian voices with international audiences\n\nLoading...\n\nMartín chose music by Margaret Sutherland and Deborah Cheetham Fraillon to open concerts during the tour. These are composers Martín only discovered when he came to Australia.\n\nHe now champions them.\n\nHis first concert with the MSO in 2022 was a world premiere of new music by Cheetham Fraillon featuring didgeridoo/yidaki virtuoso William Barton.\n\n\"My first big international tour with the orchestra is a very good opportunity to write another piece as a continuation of what we started,\" Martín says.\n\nMartín commissioned Cheetham Fraillon to compose Treaty, music which encapsulates the dialogue between the First Nations peoples and the Victorian state government in the process towards reconciliation.\n\nTreaty saw the return of Barton as soloist. The music was premiered at the Edinburgh festival and performed in Hamburg.\n\nMartín also discovered Sutherland's music after moving to Melbourne.\n\nHear the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra perform at the BBC Proms Photo shows A tight image of the orchestra facing the conductor , audience is leaning over barriers watching. Jaime Martín conducts the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in music by Dvořák, Tchaikovsky and Margaret Sutherland in this performance at the BBC Proms in London's Royal Albert Hall.\n\n\"She was an important musician in Melbourne and because of her, the Art Centre was created,\" Martín says, referring to Sutherland's advocacy for a dedicated performance venue in Melbourne.\n\nNow known as Hamer Hall, it is the venue the orchestra calls home.\n\nSutherland was a prolific composer who had been neglected because she was a woman living in an era when it wasn't acceptable for women to write music, Martín says.\n\n\"It's important to celebrate the pioneers,\" he says.\n\nHaunted Hills was composed in 1950, with Sutherland describing the music as: \"A sound picture written in contemplation of the first people who roamed the hills, their bewilderment and their betrayal.\"\n\nThese are members of the Kulin Nations who lived in the Dandenong Ranges just outside Narrm/Melbourne.\n\n\"[A lot of people] have never heard of the music of Margaret Sutherland,\" Martín says. \"I think that's very exciting and that's why we are taking this music on our tour.\"\n\nMartín attributed the enthusiasm that saw most concerts being sold out to people's curiosity to hear an orchestra from Australia.\n\n\"People are really excited to be challenged and to hear something different,\" Martín says.\n\n\" If you present [the music] with love, people will notice. \"\n\nHear the BBC Proms on ABC Classic and the ABC listen app, including the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra performing music by Margaret Sutherland, Dvořák and Tchaikovsky.\n\nGet the latest classical music stories direct to your inbox",

(ABC Gold Coast: Dominic Cansdale)\n\nWhat is No Spend September?\n\nNo Spend September has been growing as a trend on social media over the past few years, encouraging followers to cut discretionary spending — that is, unnecessary or avoidable expenses, as a kind of hard reset on finances.\n\nParticipants are encouraged to break down their spending and eliminate anything that isn't essential — including coffees, streaming subscriptions, online purchases and takeaway food for the month, while still allocating budget for rent, groceries and necessary expenses.\n\nMs Gibson says she was pleasantly surprised with last year's experience.\n\n\"More family time, park plays, long walks, and board games meant we didn't feel deprived,\" she says.\n\n\"It really made me question where all that money [we saved] normally goes and whether spending it unconsciously is really adding enough to our lives to justify it.\"\n\nThis year she and her partner, who are both teachers at public schools, want to challenge themselves further by eliminating takeaway for the month.\n\n\"Cooking every night feels a bit foreign now, but I remember when we were kids we definitely didn't have takeaway once a week.\"\n\nFinancial literacy advocate and accountant Ketvi Roopnarain says people love a challenge, and when it's limited to 30 days, it feels more achievable.\n\n\"We know there's an end in sight, and you're giving yourself space to try something. It's about pressing pause, versus stop, which makes us feel more comfortable with cutting something. If you just have to press pause for 30 days, suddenly you realise you can do another 10, and maybe another 10.\"\n\nWhy do No Spend September?\n\nFinancial behaviour expert and author of Good With Money, Emma Edwards says challenges can be a useful way to recalibrate and change your habits.\n\n\"It's really easy nowadays to get stuck in cycles of convenience spending, overwhelm spending, or doom/dopamine spending.\n\nEmma Edwards is a financial behaviour expert and author. (Supplied)\n\n\" When we say we're not going to spend on certain things for a month, we allow our impulses, our triggers and our unmet needs to rise to the surface, and that awareness can be very powerful. \"\n\nLoading...\n\nMs Roopnarain agrees, adding that it's an ideal time of year for a reset.\n\n\"Spring time is when you're taking a step back and spring cleaning, decluttering wardrobes.\"\n\nShe says No Spend September is a good time to set measurable, realistic savings goals, which could jump-start your Christmas budgeting.\n\n\"Christmas is only four months away, September could be the time where you sit down and and decide you need $300 for Christmas gifts.\"\n\nNo Spend may not be for everyone\n\nFor some, No Spend September may be a reality already, with the cost-of-living crisis squeezing people.\n\n\"For people who have already been really mindful of their spending this might not be the right thing. But perhaps there's another challenge there, like 'how do I bring more money in?'\" Ms Roopnarain says.\n\nShe recommends looking around the house to see if there are unused belongings that can be sold, in a different approach to the challenge.\n\n\"It might not be the right time for a no-spend challenge, but then perhaps there's a different challenge they might want to do, which might be how to bring in $300 over 30 days, or get rid of 30 things in 30 days.\"\n\nShe also recommends looking at essentials like utility bills and telephone bills and seeing if there are savings to be made.\n\n\"You might say 'you know what, I'm going to call my energy provider and try and get a better deal,\" Ms Roopnarain says, \"Because that money saved could go towards the Christmas fund.\"\n\nMs Roopnarain also says you can book a 30-minute call with your superannuation fund and speak with your bank about best available rates on loans.\n\nMs Edwards also cautions against taking spending challenges to the extreme.\n\nThey aren’t sustainable longer-term — and, as she points out, they’re not meant to be.\n\n\"You're not going to do a no spend challenge forever, it's meant to be a short term sprint, a concentrated period of focus.\"\n\nBeing overly restrictive for longer periods can backfire down the line if you feel frustrated.\n\n\"Being overly restrictive can, for some people, actually create a rebellion cycle where we then spend more aggressively either during or after the challenge in order to reclaim a sense of control or buck the rules that are stifling us.\"\n\nExperts on the best options if you're short on money Photo shows An unidentified woman sitting on the floor with a calculator and bills around her If you’ve got an unexpected bill to pay or large expense and you don’t have the money to cover it, here’s what you can do.\n\nWhere to begin\n\nMs Roopnarain recommends starting with why you want to take on the challenge then setting some goals around how much you're aiming to save.\n\n\"The next steps are looking at what's essential and what's discretionary,\" she says.\n\nTracking your expenses will give you visibility and help celebrate wins.\n\nFor those curious about the challenge, Ms Edwards suggests trying rotating categories each week to start.\n\n\"Mix it up and rotate categories each week so you're focusing on just one area of spending at a time.\"\n\nAnd remember, aim for progress, not perfection.\n\n\"The key with these kinds of things is not aiming for perfection, but treating it as a learning experience instead,\" Ms Edwards says.\n\n\" If you do No Spend September and you slip up and spend $50 one day, you're still better off than if you hadn't tried at all. \"\n\nThis article contains general information only.

(ABC News: Owain Stia James)\n\nThe reduction in the protein is even greater for participants who engage in more vigorous forms of exercise.\n\n\"Things like running or swimming, things that make you puff and pant,\" Dr Roccati said.\n\nGenetics play a part\n\nThe association between vigorous exercise and a reduction in the GFAP protein was less strong in participants with the ApoE4 gene.\n\nAbout 25 per cent of people carry one copy of ApoE4 and 2 to 3 per cent of people carry two copies.\n\nApoE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and dementia.\n\nWhat is the ApoE4 gene that Chris Hemsworth has?

(ABC News: Owain Stia James)\n\nProfessor Vickers said there were about 14 modifiable risk factors.\n\nSocial interaction, good sleep and reducing blood pressure are some of the ways to reduce dementia risk.\n\nHigh cholesterol, hearing loss, obesity and smoking increase the likelihood of developing the disease.\n\nProfessor Vickers said having a greater understanding how modifiable risk factors influence blood biomarkers could help predict future brain health.",

(Supplied: India Gladwood)\n\nLast week Elise Turner from the Gold Coast was asked to leave Virgin Australia's Melbourne lounge by a staff member because she was pumping breast milk.\n\nDr Turner posted on social media that when trying to defend her right to breastfeed in a public space, the Virgin employee said she was \"making her and other people uncomfortable\".\n\nUnder the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, it's unlawful to discriminate against a woman because she is breastfeeding, and that includes expressing.\n\nVictoria Marshall-Cerins, executive officer at the Australian Breastfeeding Association, says while there is a level of awareness that breastfeeding in public is protected, some people in the community still view it as \"inappropriate\".\n\n\"We know from research many women still experience negative behaviours when breastfeeding in public.\n\n\"Disapproving looks, critical comments, and … unwanted touching.\"\n\nShe says the stigma around breastfeeding in public influences parent's behaviour, impacting breastfeeding rates, and changes to community awareness and attitudes are needed.\n\nBreastfeeding in public comes with 'social rules'\n\nBreastfeeding is protected under the Sex Discrimination Act of 1984, and that includes expressing. (Adobe Stock)\n\nMs Marshall-Cerins says some breastfeeding parents expect their right to breastfeed in public to be challenged.\n\n\"And even when it is recognised as a right, there are still social rules that regulate how it should be done appropriately.\"\n\nA 2019 Australian study shows breastfeeding mothers feel pressure to meet social conditions when feeding in public, such as being discreet and covering up.\n\nThey found women felt they had to \"feed in an appropriate place to avoid discomforting others, guard against judgement, and to protect herself from the unwanted male gaze\".\n\nIndia says while she knew she wasn't doing anything wrong when feeding her son by the pool, the comment from a stranger made her feel angry and ashamed.\n\n\"I was just feeding my baby — he was having his lunch, I was reading my book.

Share with us.\n\nMore knowledge around lactation needed\n\nBreastfeeding specialist Lisa Amir from La Trobe University says a greater understanding of lactation physiology could improve the experiences of women breastfeeding and expressing in public.\n\n\"If someone is lactating, the breasts are producing milk 24/7. They can't just wait until it's a convenient time for them to breastfeed or express.\"\n\nIn addition to feeding her baby, a mother may need to express her breasts to prevent negative consequences such as mastitis.\n\n\"Or if she is not able to express frequently, milk production reduces.\"\n\nYour stories of breastfeeding in public Photo shows Nicole and her youngest breastfeeding in the pool While some caregivers told us they don't hesitate to breastfeed in shared spaces, others explained it isn't always straightforward.\n\nMs Marshall-Cerins says many people don't have lived experience with breastfeeding and therefore aren't aware of what normal infant feeding patterns look like, especially in young babies.\n\n\"Babies can be feeding anywhere from eight to 14 times a day.\n\n\"Breastfeeding in public is not necessarily the choice the community may think it is.\n\n\"It's simply a mother responding to baby's needs and cues.\"\n\nAside from hydration and nutrition, breastfeeding also offers babies physical and emotional comfort.\n\nThe sexual objectification of breasts\n\nBreastfeeding is a pro-social and pro-health behaviour, says Ms Marshall-Cerins.

It's up by $35 billion in July alone.\n\nStuart De Poi and his wife Rianna have been saving up for their first home.\n\n\"Every pay cycle, it seems like our pay goes less and less far,\" he said.\n\nStuart De Poi has been saving for a home for two years. (ABC News: Matt Holmes)\n\n\"Since having our daughter, it's been more difficult to save the amount that we need to, which pushes the horizon of when we could buy a house further and further away.\"\n\nThey have already been saving for two years to pull together a deposit and will receive some financial help from family. Without 'the bank of mum and dad' it could take them a decade just to save the deposit, perhaps longer if rates keep dropping.\n\nThe Reserve Bank started cutting interest rates in February this year, then followed up in May and August.\n\n\"At the start of the year, we were earning an interest rate of 5.5 per cent if we jumped through the hoops to meet the requirements to earn that interest rate and currently it's down to 4.8 per cent,\" said Mr De Poi.\n\nCanstar's data insights director, Sally Tindall, says while many lenders were offering ongoing savings rates at around 5.5 per cent a few months ago, now there is just one.\n\n\"But there are plenty of catches that come with this account,\" she said.\n\n\"Firstly, you've got to meet the monthly terms and conditions. Secondly, you've got to be between 18 to 29 years of age.\"\n\nSally Tindall says people with savings need to shop around to get the best interest rate. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nThere is a huge range of rates on offer, essentially from 0 per cent [base rate] up to 5 per cent.\n\n\"A competitive rate at this point in time would be 4.5 per cent and above, but you probably in most cases need to meet monthly terms and conditions in order to get that rate on an ongoing basis,\" Ms Tindall said.\n\nMeeting all the conditions can be incredibly confusing.\n\nAn Australian Competition and Consumer Commission report found that in the first six months of 2023, 71 per cent of accounts, on average, did not receive bonus interest in any given month.\n\nThat's why it's important to look at what's on offer, but choose a savings account that suits you, says wealth advisor Sulo Kulendran, from BDO Australia.\n\nSulo Kulendran says people should read the fine print when it comes to savings rates on offer. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine)\n\n\"It's really about going out there and seeing what's out in the market,\" she said.\n\nA term deposit is another option, but it does have drawbacks.\n\n\"Longer-term investments, such as term deposits might have previously given a higher rate. It's not quite the case at the moment,\" she said.\n\n\" The downside is you've got your money locked away. \"\n\nCameron has a large amount of savings in the bank and has been using the interest he earns to supplement his income from working.\n\nCameron has seen the interest he earns on his savings dwindle this year. (ABC News: Billy Draper)\n\nThe rate offered on his savings has fallen significantly — to about 4 per cent.\n\nHe tried shopping around, and thought he'd found fairly competitive rates, but the eligibility requirements were difficult to understand.\n\n\"When I looked at the various criteria that you had to have to be eligible for it actually got quite confusing in terms of you needed to have,\" he said.\n\n\"For instance, [you needed] your salary going into make a minimum number of payments from the bank account and there's certain stipulations which I found just a little bit sort of a barrier to me wanting to go down that path.\"\n\nMany Australians' savings are falling after the rate cuts. (Getty Images: Brent Lewin/Bloomberg)\n\nCameron also has a mortgage, but that's largely been offset, so the falling interest rate has not made much of a dent on his loan repayments.\n\nMs Kulendran says utilising an offset account is a sensible idea for households with a mortgage on their own home.\n\nAustralian economy grows 1.8pc Photo shows Welder works at InQuik Engineering in Newcastle. The Australian economy has grown slightly faster than economists were expecting thanks to a dramatic increase in household spending.\n\n\"Effectively what it does is it reduces the home loan balance on which the interest is charge,\" Ms Kulendran said.\n\n\"So, if your interest rate is, say 5.5 per cent, and you place some money into the offset, you're effectively getting a risk-free return of that 5.5 per cent for the amount that's sitting in the offset.\"\n\nCameron is looking to upsize his two-bedroom property.\n\n\"Now, with the interest rates falling, I'm now looking to probably use those savings to put into a new property,\" he said.\n\n\"it's beneficial that the interest rate is obviously going down if I'm going to borrow more money to put against that property.\"\n\nThe Reserve Bank next meets on the 29th and 30th of this month. However, most economists say a cut then is unlikely, given recent data, including stronger wage growth and prices.\n\nFinancial disclaimer: the information in this article is general in nature.

It has been no surprise to see Raine leading the fight. In a season when Durham’s pace stocks have been found wanting, Raine has persistently been the man running in with the determination: he has 39 championship wickets, comfortably more than the rest. In this innings, he exhibited once again his ability as a clean lower-middle order striker, but this is only his second championship century to follow one made against Worcestershire three years ago.

It’s true, my neighbour did lose the glorified shed off the top of their roof (fortunately, not in our direction. Christmas will be cancelled unless they replace that artificial tree) and another had a hefty plant pot, with plant still attached, drop on his car from two stories up (Allegedly. I say allegedly, having surveyed the damage, that’s what I think happened) to leave a sizable dent in the roof and a terminal crack in his windscreen. Overall, we got away with it quite lightly. “Having said that, if some genius on the OBO can explain, I’d love to know why Ragasa, the biggest tropical storm in the world this year, only uprooted trees, whereas six years ago Typhoon Mangkhut took mature trees and twisted their trunks halfway up as if they were matchsticks. “Anyway, the point of all of this drivel is to ask one simple question: is it really so difficult for English cricket to ensure that all of the counties have access to their best players for the T20 final and the promotion/relegation/championship deciders? “It’s obviously not a simple question. Because Sport 101 - the simplest, most rudimentary rules of running a competition - is to know what next year’s competitions are going to look like BEFORE you start this year’s. Anything else is utterly confusing, distracting and divisive. “Obviously, they couldn’t do that, but still, having the season’s success and failures decided by teams half-filled with players from “The Stiffs” is in no-one’s best interests, is it?

There are some who claim perfectly sincerely that avoiding relegation and reaching the semi-final of the Metro Cup would represent a reasonably successful season for Yorkshire. But to present reaching the last four of a developmental competition as success, while ignoring yet another summer’s failure in the Blast is like telling a 11-year-old on Christmas Day not to get too upset over the absence of a Skalextric because a dressing gown will come in very useful. You don’t just get cricket on this blog, you get emotional scars, too. And that relegation cannot yet be discounted. Yorkshire might have dominated much of the first day against Durham, their rivals in distress, but Ben Raine’s doughty assault against the second new ball (87 not out from 85 balls) sees Durham resume on 322-7 and not too far off parity. An engrossing day lies ahead. Share\n\n2h ago 19.06 AEST The Notts players are warming up with a spring in both steps, heart and lungs. Three hundred runs will clinch the Championship for them today after Surrey’s shambling day at Hampshire. The sun shines on. Share\n\n2h ago 19.01 AEST Thursday’s roundup As the season’s last round of championship cricket rolled around, players paid tribute to Dickie Bird, who died on Tuesday, aged 92. At his spiritual home, Headingley, a minute’s applause was observed, the players lining up on the pitch, and a bouquet of flowers and trademark umpire’s white cap placed on Bird’s dressing‑room balcony chair. Bird, who funded the balcony in 2015, would have enjoyed the first five overs of the day when Yorkshire reduced their fellow relegation candidates Durham to seven for two, but 93 from David Bedingham and an unbeaten 87 from Ben Raine turned the tables. Yorkshire need eight more points to be sure of Division One cricket next year, Durham may require a win because of Surrey’s impression of a soggy paper bag at the hands of fellow strugglers Hampshire. Surrey, champions for three years on the bounce, needed a maximum point win to put pressure on the leaders, Nottinghamshire. But, albeit with a side weakened by illness and the withdrawal of England players, they were dismissed for just 147, their lowest total of the season. Dan Lawrence top scored with 36. There were three wickets each for James Fuller, Washington Sundar and Kyle Abbott, who passed fifty wickets for the summer for the sixth time. Hampshire then sailed calmly to a seven-run lead at stumps. All of which was music to the ears of Nottinghamshire, who bowled out Warwickshire for 258 in a frenetic last session and now need just two more points – 300 runs – to secure the title. Warwickshire had revived at 244 for five but lost their last five wickets for 14 runs, Dan Mousley last man out for 74. Elsewhere, Steve Eskinazi made a first century for Leicestershire against Northamptonshire, Middlesex’s captain, Leus du Plooy, biffed an unbeaten 171 against Gloucestershire, the Somerset academy graduate Josh Thomas hit a run-a-ball fifty on his championship debut proper, and James Rew his fifth 50 of the summer to frustrate Essex, who remain in relegation danger. After a season of wrangling, meetings, more meetings, letters and votes, the England and Wales Cricket Board announced that the motion to remodel the County Championship structure had not received the required two-thirds majority of votes it needed to pass. The 18 first-class counties were tied at 9-9, which means the current two-division 14-game, two up, two down, competition remains. The announcement drew an immediate retort from the Professional Cricketers’ Association. The union’s chief executive, Daryl Mitchell, said the current structure was “not fit for purpose,” while its chair, Olly Hannon-Dalby, said: “Over the past two years, we have seen increasing levels of genuine concern for player health and wellbeing and as an association we represented this in the strongest possible way. Ultimately the required minimum number of 12 county chairs did not see player welfare as a priority.” Share\n\n2h ago 18.43 AEST Scores on the doors Chelmsford: Essex v Somerset 339-6 Southampton: Hampshire 154-3 v Surrey 147 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire v Warwickshire 258 New Road: Worcestershire 123 v Sussex 228-5 Headingley: Yorkshire v Durham 322-7 DIVISION TWO Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 265 v Lancashire55-0 Canterbury: Kent v Derbyshire 389-2 Lord’s: Middlesex 394-5 v Gloucestershire Wantage Road: Northamptonshire v Leicestershire 392-7 Share",

      "Title and text of article": "Does the damning planning report mean the end for Hobart's Macquarie Point stadium? It's a town-planning exercise of immense complexity.\n\nA roofed stadium at the intersection of Hobart's only major arterial routes, on the edge of a heritage waterfront CBD, in a city with limited public transport, tight time frames and at a time of budget pressure.\n\nThe Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) was scathing of the proposed Macquarie Point stadium in its draft report on March 31 — and over the coming six months, most of these concerns remain.\n\nThe final report today — recommending against the stadium — was almost just as scathing.\n\n\"This report is not unexpected,\" Premier Jeremy Rockliff said.\n\nThe panel has provided a level of scrutiny that might not have otherwise occurred, and Mr Rockliff says it is now in the hands of the parliament to decide.\n\nThe TPC report will help to guide this decision.\n\nWhy did the TPC reject the stadium?\n\nThe TPC had three main problems with the stadium: its size and location, its poor urban planning and the cost on Tasmania's budget with limited returns.\n\nOn the first point, the TPC described the stadium as a \"singular, large, bulky monolith\" that overwhelms the surrounding buildings and does not flow with Hobart's mountain-river landscape.\n\nBefore and after: See what effect proposed AFL stadium has on Hobart cityscape Photo shows A before and after composite of a stadium in Hobart. Take a look at how the multipurpose stadium is expected to look once complete.\n\nOn the second, it does not activate the land for other uses and creates an isolated precinct, while questions are unanswered about public transport, pedestrian use, car reliance and a traffic \"shock wave\".\n\nAnd the third — potentially the most scathing — was the upfront cost, amount of debt and repayments, poor economic returns and broader impact on Tasmania's public services as a result.\n\nThe project of state significance process effectively \"turns off\" planning laws, so these are seen as advice for parliament — and the advice is a resounding \"no\".\n\nLoading\n\nIs the stadium now dead?\n\nNo.\n\nThe government changed laws last year to allow the parliament to have the final say on the project of state significance process.\n\nMr Rockliff intends to introduce an \"order\" to parliament by the end of this year to approve the stadium, incorporating the feedback from the TPC and from his earlier enabling legislation to attach conditions.\n\nLabor has given unconditional support for the stadium, but now say they will \"take their time\" to consider the report.\n\nIf it has Labor's support, the order will pass the lower house, and will then require the support of three out of eight independents in the upper house to be approved.\n\nOf those eight, Meg Webb, Ruth Forrest, Mike Gaffney and Rosemary Armitage are opposed.\n\nIt means the government will be lobbying Tania Rattray, Dean Harriss, Bec Thomas and Casey Hiscutt to support the stadium.\n\nGraphic of the \"key design features\" of the proposed Macquarie Point stadium, taken from Enabling Legislation Report Consultation Draft, Hobart, May 2025. (Tasmanian government)\n\nHas the cost increased?\n\nYes.\n\nThe first estimate was $715 million in late 2022, then it increased to $775 million in 2024 after a design update, and again to $945 million in May this year.\n\nThis has increased to $1.13 billion today.\n\nThe TPC estimates the public loan at the end of the construction period will be $1 billion, which grows to $1.8 billion over 10 years due to interest.\n\nThe TPC says the construction will cost each Tasmanian household $4,100, and that $50 million per year would need to be recovered in taxes.\n\nHow will it be paid for?\n\nThe Tasmanian government has promised to cap its spend at $375 million in \"capital\" costs.\n\nThe Commonwealth has committed $240 million to the Macquarie Point precinct, rather than specifically for the stadium, and requires a plan that includes housing.\n\nThe AFL will provide $15 million — while also adding significantly more for overall grassroots football support.\n\nThe rest comes through debt, with the Tasmanian government choosing not to pursue a public-private partnership.\n\nLoading...\n\nBut won't it make money?\n\nA KPMG report, prepared for the government-owned Macquarie Point Development Corporation, estimated a cost-benefit ratio of 0.69.\n\nThe TPC report estimates it will be 0.45 — so for every $1 spent, it gains 45 cents.\n\nThere is then a disagreement over whether there are additional economic benefits from a stadium that were not quantified in these estimates.\n\nThe TPC said there was \"optimism bias\" in the government's cost-benefit figures, while Mr Rockliff said the TPC had \"massively underestimated\" the economic returns.\n\nStadiums are big. Why is this a problem for Hobart?\n\nThe TPC describes Hobart as having a \"natural layered landform\" from kunanyi/Mount Wellington down to the River Derwent, and the waterfront as \"the centre of the amphitheatre\".\n\nThe Macquarie Point stadium will dominate the Hobart skyline. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nThere are relatively few large buildings, and none near the scale and bulk of a stadium.\n\n\"It is the combination of the size, bulk and location of the stadium that cause it to be discordant with its surrounds, to such an extent as to overwhelm and disrespect them,\" the TPC report reads.\n\nOther states have built new stadiums; can't Tasmania follow their examples?\n\nThe Tasmanian government regularly points to Optus Stadium in Perth, the Townsville Stadium and Adelaide Oval as examples of recent stadium developments that have broad public support.\n\nWhat we learnt from the Macquarie Point stadium hearings Photo shows Model of a proposed stadium. Tasmania's Planning Commission is assessing the proposed Macquarie Point AFL stadium. Here's what it heard during the past fortnight's hearings.\n\nParliamentarians even went on a recent tour of Adelaide Oval.\n\nBut the TPC argues that Hobart has substantially different urban challenges, while it lacks the established public transport links of other cities.\n\n\"Unlike successful examples of city stadiums, such as Adelaide Oval or the MCG, there is inadequate space at the Macquarie Point site to mitigate the city-scale negative effects of visual bulk and homogeneity,\" the report reads.\n\nWill it still have a roof?\n\nYes.\n\nBut the proposed domed translucent roof did not escape criticism from the TPC either.\n\nIts size, height and level of translucency of the chosen material — ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) pillows — is still subject to change.\n\n\"The nominated ETFE material is reflective to at least some extent and in different light conditions, and will appear relatively luminous, not recessive,\" the report reads.\n\n\" In its setting, this will increase its perceived size. \"\n\nHow will people get to the stadium?\n\nThe government estimates that 30 to 40 per cent of people will travel by car, and the remainder by bus, ferry or walking.\n\nThere could also be park-and-ride facilities built in places like Claremont, Huntingfield and Geilston Bay, but there are no firm plans.\n\nThe TPC describes the government's mass passenger ideas as \"largely conceptual and aspirational\".\n\nA render of Macquarie Point stadium as seen from the south-east gate. (Supplied: Macquarie Point Development Coorporation)\n\nThe bus mall at the stadium still needs to be designed, while Metro Tasmania is continuing to face issues in attracting drivers, let alone staffing for 80 additional event buses.\n\nThere was also the potential to geo-block ride share services like Uber to prevent drivers from \"circling at low speeds\" and stopping in traffic lanes.\n\nCorporate patrons, however, will have access to 300 parks in the stadium's underground car park.\n\nWill it create much traffic?\n\nThe stadium is proposed for the confluence of the Brooker Highway, Tasman Highway and Macquarie/Davey streets — the only major route through Hobart.\n\nBefore and after events, streets and lanes will need to be closed, the report notes.\n\nThe closure of Davey Street during a Dark Mofo parade gridlocked the Brooker Highway, while a truck crash on the Tasman Bridge in 2023 saw traffic jams rapidly spread through suburbs.\n\n\"The Hobart CBD traffic network is not resilient and is prone to unplanned incidents creating 'shock waves' of congestion and gridlock through the network,\" the TPC report said.\n\nHas the government resolved safety issues for pedestrians?\n\nThe draft TPC report raised a range of concerns about pedestrian safety, the potential for pinch points, and emergency evacuations.\n\nThis stems from a large amount of patrons needing to walk on narrow footpaths alongside busy arterial roads, and being funnelled through a waterfront precinct.\n\nA pedestrian overpass on Collins Street is still being considered, along with the widening of footpaths on Davey Street and temporary barriers along the Tasman Highway.\n\nThe TPC saw issues as manageable, but would require significant event-day planning and resourcing.\n\nIsn't there meant to be housing too?\n\nYes, in order to obtain $240 million in Commonwealth funding.\n\nThe TPC continues to describe the proposed housing as isolated and a poor urban design outcome.\n\nSpecific plans have not been released, but the Tasmanian government says a draft plan has been presented to the Commonwealth and could be finalised by the end of this year.\n\nDo people actually want the stadium?\n\nDespite the level of public interest in Tasmania, there has been almost no reliable public polling.\n\nThis week, the Tasmania Devils released results from an online \"survey\" which it said pointed to support for the stadium from several younger demographics.\n\nPolling analyst Kevin Bonham extrapolated the data to reach an overall result of 38 per cent support, 49 per cent oppose, but was critical of the survey's methodology.\n\nHe said the best polling on the topic was by EMRS in February this year, which resulted in 36 per cent support and 59 per cent opposed.",

      "Title and text of article": "Lachie Neale and Rhys Stanley named in AFL grand final teams as Jarrod Berry fails to recover from shoulder injury Brisbane Lions co-captain Lachie Neale has made an extraordinary recovery to be selected for the AFL grand final against a Geelong side featuring Rhys Stanley.\n\nNeale, whose season was feared over three weeks ago when suffering a calf injury, replaces Jarrod Berry, who will miss Saturday's premiership decider after dislocating a shoulder last weekend.\n\nThe Cats summoned Stanley to replace five-time All Australian defender Tom Stewart, who was concussed in last Friday night's preliminary final against Hawthorn.\n\nNeale's return is a near miracle after club doctors told him he was a five per cent chance of playing again this season.\n\nLachie Neale's season was feared to be over when he hurt his calf during the qualifying final against Geelong on September 5. (Getty Images via AFL Photos: Michael Willson)\n\nThe injury was initially listed as having a season-ending four-to-six-week time frame.\n\nBut the dual Brownlow medallist was picked for the MCG showdown after the Lions held a closed training session at Melbourne's Princes Park on Thursday.\n\nNeale participated in the session but Berry was unsighted after dislocating his left shoulder in their preliminary-final win over Collingwood.\n\nBerry also suffered the same injury on August 15 against Fremantle, with the Lions unwilling to risk a recurrence in the grand final.\n\nTom Stewart was concussed after being tackled by Mabior Chol during Geelong's preliminary final win over Hawthorn last Friday.

It is yet to be decided which players will be named as the subs on the day. Geelong and Brisbane's team lists for the 2025 AFL grand final. (AFL.com.au) That's it from team selection Thursday! C By Chris De Silva I think we'll wrap things up here folks! Thank you for spending your Thursday evening with me, not long to go now until the big dance. We will be live once again for the AFL grand final, be sure to join us then. When did Brisbane get comfortable playing on the MCG? C By Chris De Silva \"Their big kryptonite used to be playing on the MCG, but that's now become a massive comfort venue as well.\" Do you have the stats on how, when that has changed? - Chris neutral observer My feeling is this group's relationship with the 'G turned in the 2022 finals. Brisbane faced then-reigning premiers Melbourne in an MCG semi-final that year and overturned a 28-point deficit to record a 13-point win. Now, they did get smacked at the MCG by Geelong a week later to the tune of 71 points, but I've always felt like that win over the Demons gave the Lions some belief. Leading up to that match, they'd lost 11 straight matches at the MCG, a streak that dated back to Round 21, 2014. I was in the stadium that night covering the game, and you could feel some kind of switch go off for Brisbane. Since that match, they've got a 7-6 record at the MCG, so it certainly isn't a fortress, but any time you have a winning record at a ground away from home, that's a fantastic result. The Lions are 4-1 at the 'G this year, including two wins over Collingwood. The only loss came against Geelong in the qualifying final. Which Geelong defender lines up on Logan Morris? C By Chris De Silva Logan Morris was held to just two kicks when Geelong beat Brisbane in the qualifying final earlier this month. (Getty Images) Looking at the team lists, there are a few interesting questions to ponder. The first is in Geelong's backline, which is of course without its leader in Tom Stewart. Mark Blicavs, who is named on the bench, will almost certainly play in the backline with Stanley returning to shoulder the majority of the ruck duties. Brisbane's forward line is spearheaded by the 20-year-old Logan Morris, who has booted 52 goals this season. Morris was held to just two kicks in the qualifying final a few weeks ago. It'll be interesting to see who gets the job on him. A look at what the team kits will be for the grand final C By Chris De Silva Neale's previous grand final numbers C By Chris De Silva Saturday's grand final will be the fourth of Lachie Neale's career. Here's how he has gone in the previous three. 2013: 7 disposals, 2 marks, 1 clearance 2023: 21 disposals, 6 marks, 5 clearances, , 3 tackles, 0.1 2024: 35 disposals, 9 clearances, 8 marks, 6 inside 50s, 3 tackles What do we think of both teams? C By Chris De Silva Righto, we're all locked in then (until the Cats decide to pull a late change on us on Saturday). I'M KIDDING, Cats fans. Seriously though, what do we think about these two teams? What match-ups are we most looking forward to? Jeff's not a fan of the Neale selection C By Chris De Silva Foolish to pick LN - Foolish to pick LN Jeff Time will tell if you're right Jeff, but this is certainly as risky a grand final selection call as I can remember for a while. Apologies if that's just my poor memory. Neale in as Lions and Cats confirm GF teams C By Chris De Silva The teams are in! Lachie Neale returns to Brisbane's side after training well throughout the week. Jarrod Berry is the unlucky party, failing to be ruled fit for the decider due to a shoulder injury. On the Cats side, Rhys Stanley makes his return from a hamstring injury, taking the place of Tom Stewart who is in concussion protocols. Will there be some mental scarring for Brisbane? C By Chris De Silva Whoever the Lions pick, surely they’re all scarred form the pounding they got earlier in the finals? - Steve I don't think so personally, Steve. These Lions are as battle-hardened as any team that's around in the AFL these days. They've seen just about every situation that another team can throw at them, whether it's a large deficit, a controversial moment, anything. Their big kryptonite used to be playing on the MCG, but that's now become a massive comfort venue as well. The big Neale question C By Chris De Silva Would you pick Neale? What are the risks of doing so? Surely if he hurts himself early, he’d just get subbed out? Or is it a bigger risk that he plays hurt, but not enough to get taken off for and is just ineffective all game? - Roar I think I'd be terrified to pick Lachie Neale, as brilliant as he is. The calf to Achilles rupture pipeline is very, very real as we've seen many times before. I don't really care how many physical tests you pass during a training session, it is simply impossible to replicate the intensity of a real game. It is also worth mentioning that Neale is 32 years old, he's right in the danger zone for an Achilles, in my opinion. If you're Brisbane, the fear would be that he does something that impacts next season and beyond. If he's able to get through the game unscathed, that is a fantastic result, regardless of whether you win or lose the game. 10 minutes to go! C By Chris De Silva Get excited people, we're almost there! A look at Jarrod Berry's numbers for 2025 C By Chris De Silva Jarrod Berry was highly influential when Brisbane defeated Geelong at Kardinia Park in Round 15. (Getty Images) Jarrod Berry isn't the big headliner in Brisbane's midfield, but he'll still be a big miss if he's not able to get up. Berry has averaged 19.9 disposals, 5.7 marks, 3.3 tackles and 1.7 clearances per game in 24 appearances this season. The grand final is the fourth time these sides are playing each other, with Brisbane winning two of the three clashes. Berry was highly influential in the Round 15 win over the Cats, picking up 26 touches to go along with 10 marks. Are we in the greatest Brisbane Lions era? C By Chris De Silva Saturday is Brisbane's third consecutive AFL grand final, a remarkable achievement. The Lions have the chance to establish themselves as one of the great modern-day dynasties if they can topple the Cats. But is this even the greatest Brisbane team of all-time? It's hard to go past the 2001-04 Brisbane sides that three-peated, but these Lions have a chance to make that conversation real interesting with a second straight flag. It so easily could've been them going for a three-peat this weekend as well, given they lost the 2023 decider by just four points. How many Lions from last year's grand final side are still around? C By Chris De Silva Joe Daniher (second from top left) is the only player from last year's premiership side who is no longer on Brisbane's list. (Getty Images) As you'd expect, there's not been a whole lot of turnover in 12 months for the reigning premiers. Only Joe Daniher, who surprisingly retired after the grand final last year, is no longer on Brisbane's list. Here's how they lined up for the grand final this time last year.

C By Chris De Silva Former premiership players Joel Selwood and Jonathan Brown hold this year's premiership cup outside the MCG. (Getty Images) Not long now until the team line-ups are confirmed. How are we feeling fans? A good grand final omen for the Cats? C By Chris De Silva Geelong has incredibly won 12 of the last 13 daytime clashes against Brisbane. This is relevant with this year's grand final start time remaining in its traditional afternoon timeslot. Will recent history repeat itself in the decider? Snoop gives a little insight into his pre-game show C By Chris De Silva The Doggfather is officially in town and set to light up the MCG before the players run out on Saturday. Here's a little sneak peak on just what exactly he's got planned. What selection gambles would you make? C By Chris De Silva We're just over an hour from the teams being finalised.
