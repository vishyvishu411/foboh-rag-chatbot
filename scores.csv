"Lachie Neale and Rhys Stanley named in AFL grand final teams as Jarrod Berry fails to recover from shoulder injury Brisbane Lions co-captain Lachie Neale has made an extraordinary recovery to be selected for the AFL grand final against a Geelong side featuring Rhys Stanley.

Neale, whose season was feared over three weeks ago when suffering a calf injury, replaces Jarrod Berry, who will miss Saturday's premiership decider after dislocating a shoulder last weekend.

The Cats summoned Stanley to replace five-time All Australian defender Tom Stewart, who was concussed in last Friday night's preliminary final against Hawthorn.

Neale's return is a near miracle after club doctors told him he was a five per cent chance of playing again this season.

The injury was initially listed as having a season-ending four-to-six-week time frame.

But the dual Brownlow medallist was picked for the MCG showdown after the Lions held a closed training session at Melbourne's Princes Park on Thursday.

Neale participated in the session but Berry was unsighted after dislocating his left shoulder in their preliminary-final win over Collingwood.

Berry also suffered the same injury on August 15 against Fremantle, with the Lions unwilling to risk a recurrence in the grand final.

Geelong ace Stewart was unavailable after entering the AFL's mandatory 12-day concussion protocols.

The brilliant backman was concussed in a tackle from Hawthorn's Mabior Chol.

The Hawk was initially given a three-match ban for rough conduct by match review officer Michael Christian, but successfully appealed against the suspension at the tribunal on Tuesday night.

Ruckman Stanley missed his club's initial two finals because of a hamstring strain, though Cats officials maintain he was available for last week's preliminary final.

The Cats named Jed Bews, Mitchell Knevitt and Ollie Henry, and Brisbane listed Sam Day, Darragh Joyce and Jimmy Tunstill, as emergencies.

Neale's return will continue to be a major talking point, though the Lions' triple-premiership winner Jonathan Brown is adamant the gamble on the prolific ball-winner is worth taking.

""He has been pain free and he's trained fully with the group for the last week,"" Brown said on Thursday ahead of teams being released.

""He's the captain of your club. We know what he's achieved as an individual.

""I think it would be a let-down for the group if he was right to play and Fages and the coaching staff didn't pick him.""

Key Events Neale in as Lions and Cats confirm GF teams 2 hours ago Geelong and Brisbane's full grand final team line-ups C By Chris De Silva Here's a look at the full team line-ups for this year's AFL grand finalists. It is yet to be decided which players will be named as the subs on the day. Geelong and Brisbane's team lists for the 2025 AFL grand final. (AFL.com.au) That's it from team selection Thursday! C By Chris De Silva I think we'll wrap things up here folks! Thank you for spending your Thursday evening with me, not long to go now until the big dance. We will be live once again for the AFL grand final, be sure to join us then. When did Brisbane get comfortable playing on the MCG? C By Chris De Silva ""Their big kryptonite used to be playing on the MCG, but that's now become a massive comfort venue as well."" Do you have the stats on how, when that has changed? - Chris neutral observer My feeling is this group's relationship with the 'G turned in the 2022 finals. Brisbane faced then-reigning premiers Melbourne in an MCG semi-final that year and overturned a 28-point deficit to record a 13-point win. Now, they did get smacked at the MCG by Geelong a week later to the tune of 71 points, but I've always felt like that win over the Demons gave the Lions some belief. Leading up to that match, they'd lost 11 straight matches at the MCG, a streak that dated back to Round 21, 2014. I was in the stadium that night covering the game, and you could feel some kind of switch go off for Brisbane. Since that match, they've got a 7-6 record at the MCG, so it certainly isn't a fortress, but any time you have a winning record at a ground away from home, that's a fantastic result. The Lions are 4-1 at the 'G this year, including two wins over Collingwood. The only loss came against Geelong in the qualifying final. Which Geelong defender lines up on Logan Morris? C By Chris De Silva Logan Morris was held to just two kicks when Geelong beat Brisbane in the qualifying final earlier this month. (Getty Images) Looking at the team lists, there are a few interesting questions to ponder. The first is in Geelong's backline, which is of course without its leader in Tom Stewart. Mark Blicavs, who is named on the bench, will almost certainly play in the backline with Stanley returning to shoulder the majority of the ruck duties. Brisbane's forward line is spearheaded by the 20-year-old Logan Morris, who has booted 52 goals this season. Morris was held to just two kicks in the qualifying final a few weeks ago. It'll be interesting to see who gets the job on him. A look at what the team kits will be for the grand final C By Chris De Silva Neale's previous grand final numbers C By Chris De Silva Saturday's grand final will be the fourth of Lachie Neale's career. Here's how he has gone in the previous three. 2013: 7 disposals, 2 marks, 1 clearance 2023: 21 disposals, 6 marks, 5 clearances, , 3 tackles, 0.1 2024: 35 disposals, 9 clearances, 8 marks, 6 inside 50s, 3 tackles What do we think of both teams? C By Chris De Silva Righto, we're all locked in then (until the Cats decide to pull a late change on us on Saturday). I'M KIDDING, Cats fans. Seriously though, what do we think about these two teams? What match-ups are we most looking forward to? Jeff's not a fan of the Neale selection C By Chris De Silva Foolish to pick LN - Foolish to pick LN Jeff Time will tell if you're right Jeff, but this is certainly as risky a grand final selection call as I can remember for a while. Apologies if that's just my poor memory. Neale in as Lions and Cats confirm GF teams C By Chris De Silva The teams are in! Lachie Neale returns to Brisbane's side after training well throughout the week. Jarrod Berry is the unlucky party, failing to be ruled fit for the decider due to a shoulder injury. On the Cats side, Rhys Stanley makes his return from a hamstring injury, taking the place of Tom Stewart who is in concussion protocols. Will there be some mental scarring for Brisbane? C By Chris De Silva Whoever the Lions pick, surely they’re all scarred form the pounding they got earlier in the finals? - Steve I don't think so personally, Steve. These Lions are as battle-hardened as any team that's around in the AFL these days. They've seen just about every situation that another team can throw at them, whether it's a large deficit, a controversial moment, anything. Their big kryptonite used to be playing on the MCG, but that's now become a massive comfort venue as well. The big Neale question C By Chris De Silva Would you pick Neale? What are the risks of doing so? Surely if he hurts himself early, he’d just get subbed out? Or is it a bigger risk that he plays hurt, but not enough to get taken off for and is just ineffective all game? - Roar I think I'd be terrified to pick Lachie Neale, as brilliant as he is. The calf to Achilles rupture pipeline is very, very real as we've seen many times before. I don't really care how many physical tests you pass during a training session, it is simply impossible to replicate the intensity of a real game. It is also worth mentioning that Neale is 32 years old, he's right in the danger zone for an Achilles, in my opinion. If you're Brisbane, the fear would be that he does something that impacts next season and beyond. If he's able to get through the game unscathed, that is a fantastic result, regardless of whether you win or lose the game. 10 minutes to go! C By Chris De Silva Get excited people, we're almost there! A look at Jarrod Berry's numbers for 2025 C By Chris De Silva Jarrod Berry was highly influential when Brisbane defeated Geelong at Kardinia Park in Round 15. (Getty Images) Jarrod Berry isn't the big headliner in Brisbane's midfield, but he'll still be a big miss if he's not able to get up. Berry has averaged 19.9 disposals, 5.7 marks, 3.3 tackles and 1.7 clearances per game in 24 appearances this season. The grand final is the fourth time these sides are playing each other, with Brisbane winning two of the three clashes. Berry was highly influential in the Round 15 win over the Cats, picking up 26 touches to go along with 10 marks. Are we in the greatest Brisbane Lions era? C By Chris De Silva Saturday is Brisbane's third consecutive AFL grand final, a remarkable achievement. The Lions have the chance to establish themselves as one of the great modern-day dynasties if they can topple the Cats. But is this even the greatest Brisbane team of all-time? It's hard to go past the 2001-04 Brisbane sides that three-peated, but these Lions have a chance to make that conversation real interesting with a second straight flag. It so easily could've been them going for a three-peat this weekend as well, given they lost the 2023 decider by just four points. How many Lions from last year's grand final side are still around? C By Chris De Silva Joe Daniher (second from top left) is the only player from last year's premiership side who is no longer on Brisbane's list. (Getty Images) As you'd expect, there's not been a whole lot of turnover in 12 months for the reigning premiers.

"Ahead of the biggest game of his NRL career, Nicho Hynes returns to where it all began AAMI Park is where it all started for Nicho Hynes, just not in the way you might think.

You have to go way, way back, a full four years before his NRL debut with Melbourne and seven years before Hynes's Dally M year, when he broke the record for most votes ever accrued in a season and was launched into the fury of the rugby league discourse machine which has been tearing him back and forth ever since.

You have to go back 10 years to the day from Friday's preliminary final between Cronulla and the Storm, back to when Hynes is still at Manly, coming off the bench for their Under 20s team, and looking back at it now he almost seems like a different person.

The flowing locks are brutally short, like a school headmaster demanded he cut them off on the first day back from the summer holidays.

Hynes began his career playing lower grades for Manly as a bench utility. (Supplied.)

On half the team sheets that year he's down as ""Nick"" or ""Nicholas"", most weeks he's coming off the bench and while he has his moments there's few clues of what's to come.

Loading...

The Sea Eagles are taking on North Queensland in the preliminary final. It's in Melbourne because the Cowboys first grade side is playing the Storm later that night, or maybe it's because the footy gods looked into the future and knew they had to do it like this just so Hynes could be back here again one day.

There are two other future Dally M winners on the field — Tom Trbojevic for Manly and Kalyn Ponga for North Queensland.

Those two are the star attractions on the night. Trbojevic's feats through the year have taken on mythical status — in one match that year he ran for 486 metres with ball in hand — while Ponga's debut a few months before was the first glimpse of one of modern rugby league's ultimate prodigies.

Hynes's first moments of rugby league stardom came during his time with the Sea Eagles. (Getty Images: Renee McKay)

Their medals are different to Hynes's because Trbojevic and Ponga were always supposed to be stars and their journey to the game's highest individual honour did not defy expectations, it fulfilled them.

Nobody looks for the same kind of brilliance from Manly's bench utility — not for a while anyway. Fourteen players from this match go on to play first grade and Hynes was the last of them to make his NRL debut.

But he finds that brilliance anyway. In the dying stages of the match, Hynes kicks a field goal to hand Manly a 25-24 win and a grand final berth.

His talent took time to blossom, but this was its beginning and the first moment Hynes looked like he could be somebody.

So much has happened in the decade since. There was the wandering through the Queensland Cup, the years spent honing his craft at Melbourne, the hot start at Cronulla and the staggeringly fast journey to superstardom.

Then came the backlash to that stardom, which was swift and merciless, and the finals crash outs and the condemnation that happened as quick as his coronation, the difficult State of Origin appearances, the kicking back against the hype machine that made and devoured him and the two finals wins already this year, which both felt transformative.

Double-edged sword of Nicho Hynes's Dally M gong Photo shows Nicho Hynes points to the sky after Cronulla Sharks' NRL win over South Sydney Rabbitohs. Cronulla halfback Nicho Hynes deserves his Dally M victory, but the Sharks playmaker will now unfairly be saddled with the weight of history.

All of it has combined to now take Hynes back to this point, for another preliminary final that doubles as the biggest game of his life.

For much of the year it was easy to overlook Hynes and the Sharks. Even accounting for the recruitment of Addin Fonua-Blake, they just seemed too similar to previous versions of themselves.

They were a team that was consistently good but never great and Hynes, as the highest-profile player on the team, was forced to wear it.

Sometimes it was fair, other times it wasn't. A halfback gets a greater share of glory and blame. That's what the money is for and that is their blessing and their curse.

What's beyond doubt is Hynes did all he could to drive the Sharks, dominating their structure the way everyone says a top halfback is supposed to — in 2023, he averaged the most touches per game of any player in the competition excluding dummy halves.

Because of their struggles in the finals in previous years, Cronulla escaped notice for much of 2025. It must have been a refreshing change of pace for Hynes especially, who has been in the spotlight enough for it to be blinding.

Something had to change and away from the bright lights, Cronulla did. A tough loss to Melbourne in Round 17 seemed to be the final catalyst and while the transformation was gradual by the time the finals arrived it was unmistakable.

Sharks star shrugs off personal barbs in NRL title race Photo shows Nicho Hynes of the Sharks celebrates by raising his arms above his head and pointing his index fingers towards the sky Accused by some of being too nice and not nice enough by others, polarising Cronulla star Nicho Hynes ""doesn't give a rats"" about criticism that comes his way anymore.

These Sharks are more physical and ruthless than the past and it's been refreshing to see them with the chip on their shoulder they've been happy to share with anyone who asks about it in recent weeks.

They've bristled at the lack of respect they've received and this anger has made them stronger than ever before because, in rugby league, a little controlled fury can solve a lot of problems.

Hynes has changed for the better as well. He does not need to dominate possessions to be effective and the combination between him, halves partner Braydon Trindall and hooker Blayke Brailey has made the team less predictable and more dangerous.

Hynes is currently averaging 56.1 touches per game, a mere ninth in the league among non-dummy halves and the first time as a Shark he's been outside the top five. In last week's win over Canberra he only kicked the ball once all night.

Hynes's performance against Canberra was a measure of how much he's changed this year. (AAP: Darrian Traynor)

The numbers prove he's doing less with more. He's scored more tries this year than any other season of his career and has equalled his try assist total from his Dally M year while leading the league in line break assists.

Learning to let go and to have a greater trust in those around him can't have been easy for Hynes. Self-belief and absolute faith in his own skills were what took him from being a bench utility in Manly's lower grades to the highest individual honours this sport has to offer.

But being able to let go ever so slightly proved to be the best move he's ever made. He doesn't try and do everything and that frees him up to do anything and it's helped Cronulla look as ready as ever to take that step from good to great.

The Sharks are well aware the only way to silence the talk around them they've come to so despise is to win a premiership and that feels very possible now.

They have the athleticism and menace across the field to trouble the Storm and their spine, Hynes included, is working together as well as it ever has.

Melbourne's record at home, especially in the play-offs, is imperious and they are warm favourites. They are not the kind of thing that falls apart because of providence alone.

But if you're looking for a sign from the rugby league gods the last time the Storm lost a preliminary final at AAMI Park was ten years ago to the day, mere hours after Hynes kicked that field goal that got him started.

Until a couple of weeks ago few thought Cronulla could be here at this moment but they had a score of believers compared to what Hynes had that night a decade ago.

His career since then, with its joy and its sorrow, is proof of what's possible, as is the recent transformation of his game and his team into something that looks like premiership material.

Hynes come a long way since the last time he was at AAMI Park with a season on the line and the ball in his hands. But he can go further still.","Ahead of the biggest game of his NRL career, Nicho Hynes returns to where it all began",sports,N/A,Abc,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-25/storm-sharks-nicho-hynes-nrl-preliminary-finals/105816184,2025-09-25 00:00:00,"Nicho Hynes returns to AAMI Park for a pivotal NRL preliminary final, reflecting on his journey from a bench utility at Manly to a Dally M winner.

"Scott Selwood takes break from AFL after 'personally challenging year' Scott Selwood will take time away from football, stepping away as an assistant coach with Collingwood following a year filled with personal tragedy.

Twin brothers Adam and Troy Selwood, brothers of Scott and Geelong premiership-winning captain Joel, died within three months of each other earlier this year.

The double tragedy for the Selwood family was mourned heavily across the wider Australian football community.

Following Collingwood's preliminary final loss to Brisbane last weekend, the club announced Selwood had chosen to step away from the game in 2026.

Selwood, a former West Coast Eagles and Geelong Cats player, had been an assistant coach with Collingwood since 2019.

In a statement released by Collingwood, Selwood said now was the right time to step away from the game after a very difficult period in his life.

""Twelve years in the system as a player and six as a coach has been some of the best years of my life,"" he said.

""It has been a personally challenging year for me, so the timing feels right to take some time for myself away from football.

""I want to thank Collingwood for allowing me to coach the game I love. To experience premiership success with the people who have become second family to me will always be a special memory.

""There is so much to love about this club, but I know what I'll miss most is the people I've been fortunate to work with across the journey and the feeling I got walking across the MCG and hearing the chant of the great Magpie Army.""

As an assistant coach, Selwood helped Collingwood win the 2023 AFL premiership.

Affectionately known as Scoot, Selwood was praised by Collingwood's executive general manager of football, Charlie Gardiner, for his contribution to Collingwood's recent success.

""Anyone that has been lucky enough to work with 'Scoot' knows he is an outstanding person and a very talented coach,"" Garner said.

"Figure skating star scraps program amid probe involving artist who co-wrote music World figure skating champion Alysa Liu is scrapping her short program for the upcoming season, including the Milan Olympics should she make the US team, amid an investigation involving one of the artists who performed the music for it.

Liu had been fine-tuning a program set to the song ""This Is How It Feels,"" performed by Icelandic singer Laufey and American artist d4vd.

But that was before the body of a missing teenage girl was allegedly found earlier this month in an impounded Tesla that was reportedly registered to d4vd (pronounced ""David""), who first rose to fame with a viral TikTok in 2022.

Body discovered in d4vd's Tesla identified as missing teen Photo shows D4vd leans against a lounge in a black jumper and grey beanie holding a microphone Celeste Rivas Hernandez was identified through forensics and a cause of death is still being determined.

The Los Angeles Police Department has not implicated d4vd in the death of Celeste Rivas Hernandez, though authorities have confirmed that his home has been searched. His representatives have not replied to requests for comment.

""I have to change it, you know? Forced to change my hand, basically. But that's alright,"" Liu told The Associated Press on Wednesday.

""I almost was grieving the process — 'Oh, I have my programs. They were going to grow and evolve, and I was going to add more to it.' But there's nothing like a fresh start.""

Most figure skaters begin working on new programs in late-spring in the Northern Hemisphere, then unveil them during a series of lower-level competitions toward the end of summer.

By the time the Grand Prix season rolls around in October, they are tightening up the elements ahead of the most important competitions, such as the Grand Prix Final and national and world championships.

Or, every four years, the Winter Olympics. The next one takes place in Italy in February.

The 20-year-old Liu is favoured to make the three-woman contingent for the US team.

The two-time national champion made a triumphant return from a brief retirement to finish second at nationals earlier this year, and then surprised the skating establishment by winning the world championship in February — the first for an American woman since Kimmie Meissner in 2006.

Liu made her season debut two weeks ago at the Lombardia Trophy in Italy, where she won the short program with her since-discarded ""This Is How It Feels"" routine. Liu wound up finishing fourth after her Lady Gaga-inspired free skate.

Liu said the plan is to create an entirely new short program with her longtime coaches, Phillip DiGuglielmo and Massimo Scali, though they are still sifting through potential music.

In the meantime, she plans to use some of her old programs for upcoming competitions; she is scheduled for the Cup of China beginning October 24 and Skate America beginning November 14.

Last year, Liu performed a short program set to ""Promise"" by Laufey and Dan Wilson, one of the members of the American rock band Semisonic. It earned her the highest scores at both nationals and the world championships in Boston.

""It's a process,"" Liu said. ""I listen to my entire playlist. I have, like, 2,000 songs on it, and I look at new artists and new music as well. I get suggestions from other people around me. But in the end, I have final says. It's always really picky.""

"Wallabies vs All Blacks Bledisloe Cup: Team lists, what time is kick-off? How can I watch? The Wallabies have named the team it hopes will win a Test match at Eden Park for the first time since 1986.

James Slipper will become the first Wallabies player to notch 150 Tests, further extending his record as the most-capped prop in Test rugby history.

The 36-year-old will join Welshman Alun Wyn Jones and New Zealand's Sam Whitelock to become just the third player to reach the milestone of 150 Tests.

Slipper will line up alongside hooker Billy Pollard and tighthead prop Taniela Tupou in the run-on front row for Saturday's clash, which doubles as a Rugby Championship encounter.

Prop Allan Alaalatoa has been named on the bench after recovering from a shoulder injury.

Scrum half Tate McDermott, who replaces the now-retired Nic White in the starting side, will bring up his 50-Test milestone.

McDermott will partner James O'Connor in the halves.

O'Connor flew to England last week to link up with his new club Leicester, but flew back to link up with the Wallabies in New Zealand after being called up again by coach Joe Schmidt.

Canberra's Ryan Lonergan has been selected for a potential Test debut as the replacement scrum half, with Tane Edmed the reserve fly half.

Max Jorgensen has been named at fullback after Andrew Kellaway injured his calf at training.

Kellaway's injury comes on top of the Wallabies losing star fullback Tom Wright to an ACL in August.

Star back-rower Rob Valetini was ruled out of this week's clash with calf tightness.

Lock Lukhan Salakaia-Loto has earned his first start for the year, selected alongside Nick Frost in the run-on second row.

Winger Harry Potter also makes his return to the starting side.

All four teams in the Rugby Championship currently boast 2-2 records, but Australia sit on top after collecting three bonus points from their four games to date.

After facing the All Blacks in Auckland, the Wallabies host New Zealand in Perth next week.

The Wallabies have not won a Test in New Zealand against the All Blacks since a 23-15 victory at Carisbrook stadium in Dunedin in 2001, although did draw 16-16 in Wellington in 2020.

The last year the Wallabies held the Bledisloe Cup was in 2002.

All Blacks miss skipper

Meanwhile, New Zealand captain Scott Barrett has been ruled out of Saturday's Test in one of four changes to the starting 15 from the All Blacks' record defeat by South Africa.

Lock Barrett has been struck down by a shoulder injury and replaced by Fabian Holland, but the skipper is expected to be available for the final Rugby Championship test against Australia in Perth, New Zealand Rugby said on Thursday.

Ardie Savea will captain the side in Barrett's stead.

All Blacks coach Scott Robertson has declined to swing the axe freely after the dramatic 43-10 loss to the Springboks at Wellington, the heaviest Test defeat in the nation's history.

However, veteran hooker Codie Taylor has been restored to the front row after going through concussion protocols, while seasoned lock Patrick Tuipulotu takes a spot on the bench after recovering from a facial fracture.

Robertson's preferred scrum half Cameron Roigard will take the number nine shirt after missing two months with a foot injury, while winger Caleb Clarke will play his first test of the season after recovering from a high ankle problem.

With rookie Leroy Carter retained on the other wing, Will Jordan has reverted to fullback, leaving Damian McKenzie demoted to the bench in place of the dropped Ruben Love.

Loose forward Peter Lakai replaces Du'Plessis Kirifi in the reserves while scrum half Cortez Ratima replaces Finlay Christie.

"Matildas strike force could benefit from having both Sam Kerr and Michelle Heyman firing fit up front Matildas striker Michelle Heyman is already relishing the idea of playing alongside a fit-and-firing Sam Kerr, believing there's room to set up a one-two punch.

Superstar goalscorer Kerr is widely expected to make her hotly anticipated Matildas return when Australia takes on Wales and England in October.

Kerr, who suffered an ACL injury in January 2024, returned to club action last week and immediately made her presence felt by netting her 100th goal for Chelsea in their 3-1 victory at Aston Villa.

A-League Women star Heyman had earned her first Matildas recall in six years to fill the void left by Kerr, returning to the national team in 2024 under then-coach Tony Gustavsson.

Melbourne City young gun Holly McNamara and Emily Gielnik, now at C.F. Monterrey in Mexico, have also stood up in Kerr's absence ahead of next year's home Asian Cup.

With five months left until the inter-continental tournament, Canberra United goalscorer Heyman says the return of Matildas captain Kerr doesn't necessarily spell the end of her time in the national team.

""I love it. I've just been so happy. I've felt for her [Kerr],"" Heyman told AAP.

""Everyone's like, 'You're in the same position, now none of you [Gielnik and McNamara] can be part of the team'.

""I'm like, 'Imagine both of us out on the field'. No-one ever thinks like that.""

If anything, Heyman believes an on-field partnership with Kerr only bolsters Australia's bid to win a trophy in front of home fans.

""I've played with Sam since she was 16 years old,"" the 37-year-old said.

""To see her run out onto the field to score, to start getting 20 minutes, 25 minutes week in, week out now — it's going to be the best boost for Australia.

""I want her on the team. I want to be on the team with her.

""If I'm not playing and she's on the field, I want to be cheering for her.

""We just want to win a trophy, so let's do it together.""

So strong is Heyman's desire to repeat Australia's 2010 Asian Cup trophy run that the 83-capped Matilda turned down an opportunity to move overseas.

Heyman remains with Canberra United for the upcoming season after becoming the first person to play 200 games in the women's competition.

""I had opportunities to go to Vancouver and change it up, but it just didn't work out,"" Heyman said.

""They will be in the off-season during Asian Cup time, and that's the time I need to be playing games.

""Having that conversation with them really gave me that no-brainer to be like, 'No, I think Canberra's it'.

""I continue to make the national team through the A-Leagues, so I think I'm doing something right.""

Heyman will kick off her A-League Women campaign when Canberra United host Newcastle Jets on November 2.

"Snoop Dogg says AFL grand final is 'a way of life' ahead of headline show After nailing two goals on the MCG, Snoop Dogg is taking his duty as grand-final headliner seriously, saying AFL is ""part of your DNA"".

The wave of controversy that followed after the AFL's announcement of the iconic American artist was all but forgotten when he strutted into a function on Thursday.

The 53-year-old said all the right things when sitting down for an on-stage interview.

The AFL declined to put Snoop up for an all-in media conference, like previous entertainers Katy Perry and Robbie Williams have done.

""I'm expecting the crowd to be crazy, I know what this means,"" he said.

""I've been coming to this country for years and I understand what this game is and what it means.

""I know that it's not just a sport, it's a way of life.

""I know it's not just a team or club, it's part of your DNA, so I understand what is at stake.

""I'm here to do my part and to bring what I bring to the table.""

Snoop made an instant impact on arrival in Melbourne, having a kick on the MCG on Tuesday with Collingwood stars Nick and Josh Daicos.

The self-proclaimed athletic sports fan spectacularly kicked both of his kicks through for a goal, even one tricky snap from the pocket.

The famous artist, responsible for hits like Drop It Like It's Hot, Beautiful, and Gin and Juice, has even had his own footy card made, posting it to his 88.6 million Instagram followers.

Snoop will be joined by some ""special"" guests, who will be a surprise on the day.

Australian artists Vera Blue, Tash Sultana, Baker Boy and footy anthems man Mike Brady have already been confirmed in the line-up.

Snoop played it safe when asked for a tip between Geelong and the Brisbane Lions.

But he was presented with a jumper from both of the competing teams — the Lions one with Snoop on the back, the Cats guernsey with Dogg.

""I'm not going to split half the people that love me,"" he said.

AFL boss Andrew Dillon defended the decision on the entertainment.

""I've been really confident with the choice of Snoop,"" he said.

""He's performed at the Olympics, he's performed at a Super Bowl, and he'll suit our stage.

"NT para athlete Briseis Brittain wasn't born when Cathy Freeman won Olympic gold, but the moment fired a dream It's a career that started playfully along the dirt tracks of Ramingining in the Northern Territory's remote Arnhem Land, but now Briseis Brittain is steely focused as she steps out onto international tracks.

The 17-year-old runs because it feels ""fun and free"", and now she's representing Australia at the World Para Athletics Championships in New Delhi, India.

""I am so excited to represent Australia … racing against people in different countries,"" Briseis says.

Shoulders back, chin high, Briseis beams as she steps out in green and gold.

It's the first time she's left Australia, and the international debut also marks a milestone for her community.

""I am the first Arnhem Land woman from Ramingining and Maningrida [to compete at this level], and I am going to make proud my people and my culture,"" Briseis says.

It's a passion fuelled by the success of Cathy Freeman, an Aboriginal Olympian cloaked in glory after taking gold in the 400 metres at the Sydney 2000 games.

""Cathy Freeman was my favourite athlete, she was really amazing and talented, I want to be like her,"" Briseis explains.

"" It was my dream since I was little. ""

Invested in making that dream a reality, Briseis's family relocated to the Northern Territory capital of Darwin.

Briseis's mother Marcey Garrawurra says she always knew her daughter had what it took to make it to the world stage.

Loading...

""There's lots of talented kids from Arnhem Land but it's just there's not much [athletics] opportunities there — that's why I came to Darwin,"" Ms Garrawurra says.

""I am always proud watching her run.""

Remote Arnhem Land is now abuzz, with family preparing to get online and watch Briseis run against the world's best para athletes in New Delhi.

""It's really, really, really special for me and my family that she is going to represent Australia and our family,"" Ms Garrawurra says.

""It's what I want for her.""

Going neck-and-neck with the world's best has its hurdles when you live in Darwin, a capital city that is geographically isolated and has a population of just over 150,000 people.

There aren't enough para athletes in the city to have a standalone competition, so Briseis has been racing against peers without disabilities.

To refine her ""powerful"" running style, coach Roger Chin has employed AI, sending videos of her sprints to an interstate company for movement analysis and correction.

Roger Chin says competing in New Delhi will be a unique experience and new challenge for Briseis Brittain. (ABC News: Marcus Kennedy)

""She is a raw runner, she uses a lot of power when she does run and she never gives up,"" Chin says.

The coach notes that racing in a huge international contest will be a significant test for Briseis.

""[It's a] new environment, new country, new people, new cultures — the pressures put on her will be quite high,"" Chin says.

For many of these athletes, success at the games won't be measured in medals. They instead hope the competition can help prepare them for the ultimate goal of competing at the Paralympics in LA in 2028 and Brisbane in 2032.

Briseis Brittain will be competing with other para atheltes from all around the world. (ABC News: Marcus Kennedy)

Stephen Caddy is the head of the Para Program at Australian Athletics's high-performance department.

He's been preparing the Australian para athletes squad in Dubai, running mock races and getting the team acclimatised to tropical conditions, with much of the team having flown in from a southern winter.

""We've got a number of other nations staging there with us — the Netherlands, Denmark, Great Britain and Canada,"" Caddy says.

""Obviously, with the para team, we have to move a lot of staff with a lot of athletes for support purposes, so it'll be a wave and staggered approach into New Delhi.""

Briseis Brittain is now with the squad preparing in New Delhi.

""We've got Briseis Brittain who will be competing in the 200 and 400m,"" Caddy says.

""[She] is in the T-38 class, for athletes with minimum impairments but with motor impairments.""

Briseis Brittain has been working closely with her coach Roger Chin to prepare for the world championships. (Supplied.)

With 51 team members, this year's Australian para squad is the biggest since the 2000 Sydney Paralympic Games.

Caddy says these are the para athletes who will shape the nation's sporting future.

""We've got a massive team, it's our second largest world championships team ever that we've taken for para athletics,"" Mr Caddy says.

Briseis's qualification from far-flung Darwin is an exciting opportunity for the Australian team.

""I've been operating teams for about 10 years, I can't remember the last time, or if in my time, there's been a Northern Territory athlete on our para team,"" Caddy says.

He says unprecedented federal government funding is helping to build and prepare Australia's para sport movement.

Almost $55 million will be used to help athletes like Briseis overcome barriers to developing and competing, through the Para Uplift sport program.

""It's great to see some opportunities present in that region,"" Caddy says of the NT.

""We know that area produces some great athletes, it's only a matter of time before we start recognising the potential in the para athletic space or para sport space as well.""

"Alexa Leary and Callum Simpson win gold medals for Australia at World Para Swimming Championships in Singapore Alexa Leary was peerless in Singapore to claim gold in the women's 100m freestyle S9 at the World Para Swimming Championships, beating her nearest competitor by almost three seconds.

Leary's win in the final individual event of Wednesday night's action in Singapore bookended a golden night for Australia after Callum Simpson won gold in the first event of the evening.

After putting in a strong performance during the heats, Leary was a red-hot favourite to take gold and threaten to better her own world record of 58.89 seconds.

Leary went hard in the opening 50 metres of Wednesday's final in pursuit of another world record but fell narrowly short of that milestone, claiming the gold medal with a time of 59.19 seconds.

Despite wanting to better her own mark, the Australian said she had achieved her most important goal.

""Of course I am a bit disappointed, I was so close to the record in the morning but I'm really proud that I got it (the gold). That is the biggest that I wanted,"" Leary said.

""I've still got more left in the tank and now I'm even more determined to beat my 50m world record later this week, just you wait.""

Leary holds the world's best mark in the women's 50m freestyle S9, setting the mark at 27.23 seconds in Sydney back in May.

Leary shaved just 0.02 seconds off the previous best mark held by American Raleigh Crossley.

Leary and Crossley will get their chance to battle in the 50m freestyle on Saturday.

Meanwhile, Simpson set an Oceania record time of 57.15 seconds to win the men's 100m freestyle S8 to open proceedings on Wednesday.

Simpson was made to work hard for his world championship gold, narrowly beating Italy's Alberto Amodeo (57.88) and Ukraine's Eduard Horodianyn (58.14) to the wall.

""I was definitely not expecting to go that fast and break the Oceania record, or for the race to be that quick,"" Simpson said.

"Nottingham Forest draws 2-2 with Real Betis in opening UEFA Europa League match Nottingham Forest's long-awaited return to European competition ended in a 2-2 Europa League draw at Real Betis, with Igor Jesus's first-half double cancelled out by a late Antony strike.

Forest's return to a major European competition for the first time since March 1996 began on the wrong foot, with Betis taking the lead inside 15 minutes when Cedric Bakambu fired an effort high into the net.

The two-time European Cup winners responded swiftly as Jesus levelled from close range within two minutes and then headed in again in the 23rd minute.

Both sides pushed for a breakthrough following the interval. Betis gradually seized more control as the match wore on and were finally rewarded five minutes from time, when Antony tucked away Marc Roca's cross to ensure the spoils were shared.

With the result, Forest boss Ange Postecoglou became the club's first permanent manager since Billy Walker in 1946 to go without a win in his opening four matches.

""I think first I should be proud of the players' efforts. It's a difficult place to come, difficult conditions, people don't realise the humidity out there,"" Ange Postecoglou said to TNT Sports.

""I'm just disappointed that the players and supporters don't get the rewards for our efforts. I've just got to make sure they keep their heads up because there's plenty to be positive about and the wins will come.""

ABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.

Postecoglou guided Tottenham Hotspur to claim the Europa League title last season, the London-based club's first trophy in 17 years, and first continental trophy in over four decades.

But a poor English Premier League campaign, where Spurs finished a lowly 17th, led to the Australian being sacked at the end of the season.

Postecoglou was named Forest's manager earlier this month.

Previous manager Nuno Espírito Santo, who had led the club back to qualifying for European football, had started the season with a win, loss and draw.

Since Postecoglou took over, Forest was beaten by Arsenal 3-0 and drew 1-1 with Burnley in the EPL.

Forest also blew a two-goal lead in the second half to be knocked out of the League Cup by Championship side Swansea.

Forest's next match will be at its home ground on Sunday, AEST, against Sunderland in the EPL.

"Why the legacy of the 2023 NRL grand final hangs over the Broncos and Panthers It takes a lot to distract a Panther this time of year, even for a second, days out from the rapidly approaching preliminary final.

Penrith have a belief in process that borders on worship and ahead of Sunday's clash with Brisbane, a task can be as big as a training session or as small as an interview and they'll still look to do it well.

But Moses Leota, their hardman prop, is looking over someone's shoulder.

We are out the front of the Panthers Rugby League Academy and there is a television in the foyer. It's running a loop of highlights from the club's four-straight premiership titles.

Penrith remind Canterbury there can be only one Photo shows A man celebrates after scoring a try Canterbury is a team built in Penrith's image, but the Panthers served Canterbury a stark reminder that there can be only one.

Leota's played in all four and did a damn fine job in each. Like everyone who's lasted at Penrith, his ability to focus on whatever is in front of him at the expense of everything else is one of his greatest strengths.

But there is a second when his mind goes to other things. He seems to be looking past the tinted glass doors just as the business end of the 2023 grand final starts heating up.

""Ah, yeah, maybe I was watching a little,"" Leota said.

""I saw my try, so I was smirking a bit.""

That 26-24 victory, where Penrith came back from 24-8 down with 18 minutes left, is perhaps the only thing that could get a Panther feeling a little nostalgic this time of year.

They're only human, even if they don't always seem it, and even if there's still work to be done right now, that night two years ago is a memory worth basking in.

It was not their first premiership together nor their last. It did not avenge the defeat that created them nor give them eternal bragging rights over their fiercest local rivals.

That year's top 17 was not the best team of the dynasty and the game itself was not their most complete performance.

But it was Penrith's greatest win and finest hour, the biggest comeback in grand final history and the truest expression of everything that has led to all the glory and the trophies and the winning.

It started with Leota's try and ended with Nathan Cleary's premiership score in the 78th minute. Most of that night is a blur for Leota, but the memory of what happened after his four-pointer stands out.

""It was all positive, thinking about the process. We were still two tries down and had a lot of work to do, so there was no celebrating,"" Leota said.

""It was back to the process. The rest of it is a bit of a blur. I just remember after the game celebrating with anyone and everyone.""

Whenever all this ends — and after their win over Canterbury last weekend, it's fair to ask if it ever will — the 2023 grand final will be the first game that comes up whenever someone makes the case that these Panthers are the greatest team of all time.

It's the kind of match that will bring an extra weight to every Panthers-Broncos finals match for many years to come and it looms over Sunday like an approaching storm cloud, darkening the sky and heralding thunder.

Eleven Panthers players will be backing up for the rematch versus nine returning Broncos and watching a replay of the game now, less than two years after the fact, is an easy finals footy gift to give to yourself, assuming you're not of a maroon and gold persuasion.

In one of the best games of the NRL era, Leota stands out as an unsung hero, not just with the try that got the fightback started, but with the same punishing carries he always seems to find when things matter most.

Nathan Cleary is just as remarkable as you remember with his three try assists, a 40/20 and the match-winning score in the 78th minute. The departed Jack Cogger rides shotgun and Stephen Crichton shows the full breadth of his skill and class with a try and two forced dropouts.

Panthers hooker Mitch Kenny is not known for his attacking craft, but he finds just enough of it in the lead up to Cleary's try, faking to go open before hitting his halfback down the blind and forcing an overchase from Brisbane's Jordan Riki as he comes back across to cover.

Watch it enough times when you already know the end of the story and new moments, great and small, reveal themselves.

With 10 minutes to go and Brisbane's lead cut down to four, Reece Walsh rounds a cluster of defenders and bursts into space. Ezra Mam is on his left in support, but can't be positioned for what would have been his fourth try of the night.

At the end of that set, Adam Reynolds does not put a kick in but instead hits Brendan Piakura with a crash ball on the last for a turnover on Penrith's 20. From there until full-time, Brisbane only had possession for 10 more tackles.

Down the stretch, Brisbane became desperate and conservative. The freewheeling football that built their lead in the first place vanished well before the lead itself.

Walsh grabs the Sun to light up Brisbane's season Photo shows A man celebrates after winning a rugby league match Brisbane and Canberra went to the great beyond in their golden point finals match and it was Reece Walsh who led the Broncos to the promised land.

It wasn't a grand final, but it's exactly the same place where the Broncos sent Canberra two weeks ago in their own riotous comeback victory, which delivered them this home preliminary final and set them on the path to potential deliverance.

In that game, they showed a resilience which has been in short supply since the grand final loss and the 29-28 classic was a sign of what has changed for them in the years since, from the coach on down.

While painful memories are not easily banished, it's a different kind of Brisbane team who will take the field at Lang Park as they search for a way to exorcise these demons in front of 52,000 true believers.

They will have to overcome Pat Carrigan's suspension and Penrith themselves, who seem to have hit that championship form just at the right time, just as they have for four years in a row now.

Billy Walters' ACL injury and Adam Reynolds and Ezra Mam's return from hamstring problems mean the halves situation is unclear, but with Reece Walsh playing the way he is nothing else seems to matter all that much, and through him and Payne Haas, all things feel possible.

They will attempt to leave 2023 behind, but even if we're through with the past, that doesn't mean it's through with us.

The Panthers will happily tell you how losing the 2020 grand final to the Storm propelled them to greatness and before that grand final win over the Broncos, the best win of the dynasty was the 2021 preliminary final victory over their one-time conquerors.

If the Broncos can get up and end the Panthers 14-match finals winning streak, it means Penrith will have, in some way, created something that ends up destroying them just as Melbourne did with them all those years ago.

ABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.

But Penrith has survived such reckonings before. Plenty of challengers have shown up on the season's biggest days running with the steel of vengeance in their hearts due to one former battle or another, only to be struck down without mercy.

Their dynasty is built on the shattered remains of their challengers and that's a pile so high it'll be a landmark in rugby league history forever.

And right at the top, staring down at the world they have created, is the last 20 minutes of that grand final win over Brisbane.

For the Broncos, that game can be a beacon calling them to vengeance and if they can get it, perhaps some greatness of their own beckons in this year's decider.

It can be their inspiration, but Penrith gave up needing to be inspired long ago. Their worship of process is enough and 2023 is eternal proof of that concept.

It's the reason they seem like they can go forever and it's perhaps the only thing that can get them looking back, even for a moment, when there's still so much in front of them.

"Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera being robbed overshadowed Matt Rowell's Brownlow Medal win, and could change the voting process forever If the most memorable moment out of your code's ""night of nights"" doesn't even involve the winner, you've got a problem.

This is where the AFL is at with the Brownlow Medal after another bizarre count led to more questions about the voting process and whether the umpires should still be in charge of deciding who wins the award.

Loading...

The moment in question arrived towards the back end of what was at that point an exciting count as the eventual Brownlow Medal winner, Matt Rowell, held off his closest challenger, Nick Daicos.

When Round 20 arrived, AFL CEO Andrew Dillon — who reads the votes from each game — had increased his already breakneck reading speed, particularly for games not involving contenders like Rowell and Daicos.

Dillon was buzzing through the St Kilda – Melbourne game, better known as the Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera game, when he read out the words that might alter the future of what has always been considered the most prestigious award an AFL player can win: ""St Kilda, N Wanganeen-Milera, two votes.""

The reaction from around the room said it all.

Players are so used to keeping their poker face on during events like this, but Wanganeen-Milera couldn't help himself, cartoonishly popping his eyes out in disbelief.

His teammate and St Kilda captain Jack Steele's hands said what his words couldn't at that point.

Over at the Melbourne table, the Demons burst out into laughter after veteran Demons midfielder Jack Viney, he of 23 disposals and 16 tackles, took home the three votes.

For context, Wanganeen-Milera finished that game with 34 disposals and four goals, and ended the game doing this.

Wanganeen-Milera's game was so prolific that it was almost instantly regarded as the best individual game of the season and perhaps of this generation. It was so good that Simon Goodwin referenced it in his farewell press conference when he was sacked as Melbourne's coach just a few weeks later.

The AFL, like its rival sporting codes around the world, stays alive long after the final goal of the season is kicked due to legacy conversations between fans in every corner of Australia.

No matter what the sport is, these conversations all go the same way.

How many premierships have they won? How many All-Australian jackets? How many Norm Smiths? At some point in the conversation comes the inevitable question: How many Brownlows?

Moments like the Nasiah game might alter how these conversations go from now on, because it is clear the Brownlow has lost some of its lustre.

Can we still use the Brownlow as a means by which to decide where players sit on the all-time pyramid? Perhaps not.

It has long been decided that this is an award that only midfielders can win despite some of the game's most valuable players being those that play in key positions.

Midfielders seemingly having a monopoly on the Brownlow has led to hilariously bloated vote totals in recent years.

Last year, Carlton skipper Patrick Cripps smashed the record by polling 45 votes.

This year's runner-up, Daicos, has now polled 98 votes in the last three years without really coming close to ever winning the Brownlow.

Daicos's average of 33 votes over the last three seasons would have won him the Brownlow in all but six seasons under the 3-2-1 voting system.

Noise about whether the voting should be taken off the AFL's umpires isn't new, but will feel as intense as ever at league headquarters following the reaction to Wanganeen-Milera's two-vote game.

In yesteryear, the umpires were permitted to have stat sheets to assist them when deciding which players to award votes to. That is no longer allowed due to integrity concerns surrounding the award following a controversial betting scandal involving a former umpire.

Fans genuinely considered whether umpires had gotten Gold Coast stars Noah Anderson and Matt Rowell confused, such was the bizarre nature of votes awarded in certain Suns games. (Getty Images: Michael Willson)

If stat sheets were available to aid the umpires, it is very likely Rowell would not have taken home the Brownlow this year.

On three separate occasions in the early part of the count, the Suns midfielder took home three votes in games where he didn't poll a single coaches vote.

It is proof that the disparity between how the umpires see the game and how the coaches see the game has never been greater.

The voting involving Suns games was so confusing at stages that fans on social media genuinely wondered whether umpires had gotten Rowell and fellow Suns midfield dynamo Noah Anderson confused.

It was something that Rowell himself couldn't help but allude to in his victory speech, as he paid tribute to the impact his best friend, Anderson, has had on his career.

""I think I might've pinched a few votes off him that he should've got,"" Rowell said.

The sad part of the voting controversy is that it takes away from what is undoubtedly the highlight of Rowell's young career.

The AFL has been waiting on Rowell and the Suns for a few years, but this is further confirmation that both have well and truly arrived.

The way in which Rowell's victorious count began was similar to how he arrived in the AFL after being taken first overall in the 2019 draft by a floundering Suns side.

Rowell was touted as a future Brownlow winner just a month into his AFL career before a shoulder injury at Kardinia Park dragged his career to a screeching halt.

Rowell was awarded the Brownlow Medal after a career-best season that saw him average 26.3 disposals, 8.6 tackles and 8.2 clearances per game. (Getty Images: Chris Hyde)

The votes at the end of that season showed he'd polled three votes in his second, third and fourth career games, something unseen in a first-year player.

This year he went one better, becoming the first player in league history to poll three votes in each of his first four games.

After Daicos came into the night as the raging hot favourite, this was the first sign that the night wouldn't go to plan for the Collingwood superstar.

The voting drama shouldn't take away from what a wonderful footballer Rowell has become, as many predicted five years ago.

Rowell took some time to recover from the shoulder injury in his debut season, but this year showcased all the traits that made him one of the most hyped top picks heading into the 2019 draft.

He is able to take a game by the scruff of the neck like very few midfielders in the competition can.

You want to stop him? You better have three or four midfielders willing to take on the gargantuan task of denying him when the ball is in the same postcode.

The scary part for the rest of the AFL is that Rowell only seems to be scratching the surface of how good and dominant he can really be.

To take home the Brownlow, you've got to have a few things go your way.

You need to be on a team that is decent enough to be in the top eight, unless you're an all-timer like Gary Ablett Jr.

You need to stuff the stat sheet, but that alone isn't enough. The stats need to be impactful.

This is where Rowell thrives.

When Rowell is having a good game, it is impossible not to feel it, even if you're just watching the Suns play on TV while sitting in your living room.

Each possession feels impactful and deflates Rowell's opponents. It is how he is able to take home three votes in games where he's logged possession tallies in the mid-teens.

In previous generations, the Brownlow Medal was the crowning achievement for a player. It was a sign that you had arrived as one of the game's elites.

Rowell is one of those, his accolades outside of the Brownlow Medal suggest this.

Sadly, the medal that used to previously rubberstamp a player's arrival in the upper echelon of the game no longer carries the weight it once did.","Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera being robbed overshadowed Matt Rowell's Brownlow Medal win, and could change the voting process forever",sports,N/A,Abc,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-23/afl-matt-rowell-nasiah-moment-brownlow-medal-voting-analysis/105804320,2025-09-23 00:00:00,"The recent Brownlow Medal ceremony was overshadowed by controversy surrounding the voting process, particularly the decision to award only two votes to Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera for a standout performance.

"Penrith's win over Canterbury was a reminder there is no team like them After all this time, it is hard to find new ways to talk about the Panthers, but such was their excellence in the 46-26 win over Canterbury that we are going to have to try.

The Bulldogs are trying to build themselves in Penrith's image and at times this season they have done a better than fair impression, but this was a reminder there can be only one.

Even though the Panthers were warmly favoured, the contest felt alive as the blue and white horde filed into Stadium Australia.

The stakes will always be high between these two because there are enough former Panthers now in blue and white that these games feel personal.

Panthers batter Bulldogs Photo shows Paul Alamoti and Izack Tago celebrate Penrith has crushed Canterbury-Bankstown after a phenomenal first half to claim a 46-26 victory, keeping their hopes of a fifth-consecutive NRL premiership alive.

Those personal battles have brought the best out of the Panthers all year, but none have inspired anything like what happened today.

What happened in the first half, as Penrith ran in six tries, was decadent enough that it felt indecent to watch.

Replays should come with the disclaimer they used to play on television before violent movies.

There were all the hallmarks of classic Panther football like the ferocious and finely focused power, the obsessive attention to detail, and a defensive attitude that would border on homicidal if it happened off the field.

The usual suspects — like Nathan Cleary, Isaah Yeo and Brian To'o — were at the heart of it with the sort of football that has made them the legends of their time as the Panthers completed their first 27 sets of six.

Newer faces played their part, like Blaize Talagi, who forced two errors with his rushing defence, and Paul Alamoti, who, much like To'o, never met a rugby league problem he could not solve by running over someone.

The two wingers were astonishing as they combined for five tries and two assists and ran for over half a kilometre with the ball in hand.

More tricks came later and from unusual performers, which made them all the more dazzling.

Hooker Mitch Kenny, who had kicked the ball three times all year before Sunday, put in an inch-perfect grubber for a try.

Bench prop Liam Henry, the hard man who scored it, put the ball down with an acrobatic flip that is perhaps the flashiest thing anyone from Blayney has ever done.

By the time To'o finished off a circus act of a try by centre kicking off his wrong foot for Isaiah Papali'I, the score was 36-8 and the game felt over.

The second half, for Penrith at least, was perfunctory. They had to endure it before they could focus on next weekend's preliminary final with Brisbane, a game for which the word blockbuster feels woefully inadequate.

This was the Panthers' 14th finals win in a row, and Canterbury, like the 13 sides before them, is now left to pick up the pieces after running into the monster that lives at the end of so many premiership dreams.

The Bulldogs are a team that has been looking to the future for some time. The moves that will define their season in the history books — the mid-year acquisition of Lachlan Galvin and dropping Reed Mahoney for Bailey Heyward — were as much about the future as they are about the present.

They may well pay off down the line. In a badly beaten side, Galvin produced some fine touches and his first-half try, where he put Jacob Preston into a gap around halfway before backing up to score, was the moment when a Bulldogs win felt the most possible.

But it is hard to square that with what Canterbury were to begin the year as they surged to the top of the ladder and stayed there for months on the back of a swarming, exhausting style that had more than a little Panther about it.

Those Bulldogs were driven and committed and, above all, certain. The 13 on the field played as one and left their opponents gasping for air, and they took to this rugby league suffocation like they had found their calling in life.

Such certainty has been in steadily shortening supply for months now. They entered this game having won just two of their previous seven matches despite some valiant efforts.

Injuries struck at horrible times, forcing Matt Burton to the centres and Stephen Crichton to the sideline and they paid the price for it as the Panthers exploited their fresh combinations on the edges with a ruthlessness that, when the dust settles, the Bulldogs will aspire to.

But until further notice, aspiring to be like the Panthers is all they can do. Until the dynasty finally falls, it is all anyone can do.

Teams try to follow, but even if they know the way, nobody has survived the journey for 14 games and four premierships in a row.

"Collingwood and Brisbane meet again, two years on from classic 2023 grand final, for tantalising rematch Two years ago, football was graced by one of its truly special matches. It wasn't a shootout or a slog, but a well-balanced, seesawing affair.

It happened on the biggest stage of all, in front of the biggest crowd in the country, in full voice. The 2023 AFL Grand Final saw twists and turns throughout, with 10 lead changes leaving fans near and far on the edges of their seats.

Steele Sidebottom's clinching goal has been etched in the annals of history, cementing Collingwood's 16th flag. Brisbane ended the year so close, yet so far away from that ultimate success.

Twelve months later, the Lions were able to redeem themselves at the MCG. Collingwood was absent from that procession, with Sydney acting as its proxy for the day. While the Lions have their flag, there's still a sense of unfinished business for the reigning premiers.

Saturday's preliminary final between Collingwood and Brisbane is set up to be a test between the two best teams of the last three years. Each has a flag in that time, and they've split their encounters this year.

Whoever wins the rubber match not only gets the glory but also a chance at adding another premiership cup to their recent tally.

The champs are here

The reigning premiers' title defence remains alive after a week one loss, and despite a couple of core-shaking injuries. Despite the loss of veterans Lachie Neale and Eric Hipwood, the Lions remain in the thick of the title race.

The key to the Lions' game plan is how they control the football.

Brisbane focuses on holding the ball in solid field position, taking some pace off the game, and chaining together uncontested marks. Brisbane takes the most uncontested marks in the competition, thriving in games with more marks than ground balls.

But that's not to say they can't win when the pace battle doesn't go their way.

Last week, Brisbane rolled over the top of the strongest ground ball team in the league in the Suns. Gold Coast successfully forced the ball to the deck in the second quarter, but Brisbane was able to win loose balls and the lead. After gaining the ascendancy, the Lions took the pace out of the game and the ball off the deck.

The territory battle will be crucial, with both Brisbane and Collingwood wanting to play a high press and dominate territory. Both sides tend to use repeat entries to score and cut off opposition attempts at escape from their own defensive 50.

The Lions have also been quite effective scoring from stoppages in and around their forward 50. The Lions score more than any other side from stoppages in the front third of the ground.

Zac Bailey leads the league in scoring out of forward stoppages, but is far from the only contributor. Brisbane runs deep up forward, with a wide variety of first receivers and deeper targets.

When getting the ball from stoppages, the Lions also vary it a lot. Some sides run their frontline mids as the target at stoppage, others use dangerous small forwards. Brisbane can use a variety of options going through the pack and as second receivers, creating uncertainty in defensive coverage.

Brisbane's major weakness lurks at the other end of the field, whenever teams manage to beat its upfield defence. Injuries to Jack Payne, Tom Doedee and Keidean Coleman have hurt their deeper defence, with a former strength becoming a potential weakness.

Among finalists, the Lions have been clearly the most vulnerable when the opposition goes inside 50. Oppositions have found a mark about one-quarter of the time, with only Fremantle conceding more points per forward foray. If the Pies can get the ball past the Lions' high press, the Lions' stay in September could come to a premature end.

In round seven this year, Collingwood followed this template to find 13 marks inside 50 to walk away with a massive 52-point victory.

The Pies found 10 different goal kickers on the day to stretch the Lions' defence. Some of the damage was done higher up the ground, with Collingwood dominating clearances and territory throughout.

The Lions were able to get better control of the ground game in their return match in round 21. Although Collingwood was again able to find easy marking targets inside 50, the Lions dominated scoring from stoppages to walk their way to a 27-point win. The paths to victory narrow significantly if they can't defend the air inside 50 effectively.

The Lions will need to work out how to overcome this if they have any chance at defending their title.

Swoop low, sweet chariot

Coming into the finals on a cold streak, some tipped Collingwood's finals stay to be short. Instead, the 2023 premiers are firmly in contention for a return to the grand final. In the Magpies' way is the side they beat for that drought-breaking flag.

Collingwood has entered the finals as the only side not in the top eight in attack. Despite this, it remains in the thick of the action due to the way it stops other teams. The Pies conceded fewer points than any other side this year.

The Pies are an all-round defence with a particular focus on cleaning up their own messes. Led by captain Darcy Moore, Collingwood concedes the fewest points per turnover it gives away, and also sits in the top four for defending inside 50 entries.

When the Pies do get it forward, they approach attacking in a different way than most sides.

Collingwood takes more shots from long range than any other side, and scores more goals from there than anyone.

Its accuracy is around league average, but the threat is still enough to shift defences and potentially draw players out of position. That's partially due to its personnel — it doesn't have a long list of tall targets deep, instead relying on leading forwards and players who excel at ground level inside 50.

The speed that the Pies deploy up forward can be hard for other teams to counter — especially when paired with the likes of Sidebottom, Scott Pendlebury and the Daicos brothers delivering the ball inside 50.

Credible long-range shots stretch the threat envelope, opening up other scoring avenues as defenders leave pockets of space closer to goal. The way Collingwood attacks can throw opposition sides off guard unless they have done their homework.

Part of the issue around Collingwood's attack stems from a growing weakness this year. The Pies have the third-worst ground ball win differential in the league, ahead of only West Coast and Port Adelaide.

Collingwood has not excelled at winning ground balls in the McRae era, instead prioritising how it defends losses. Instead of looking to win any ground ball, the Pies work hard to capitalise on the most valuable ones and turn them into scoreboard pressure.

The Pies also knock and surge the ball forward without gaining full control — part of what drives their territorial advantage (second for time in forward half). Still, there's a tipping point where they can get starved of the ball and become unable to capitalise in attack. This can leave them vulnerable in shootouts or when needing to catch up.

In round 21 this year, the Lions won 30 more ground balls to surge their way to victory. That's despite Collingwood successfully taking the game away from the aerial, control style that the Lions usually thrive under. The Lions have a number of talented gatherers at ball level that can open teams up with half a chance.

For the Magpies to win a ticket to next week's game, they will need to work out how to nullify the Lions at ground level as well.","Collingwood and Brisbane meet again, two years on from classic 2023 grand final, for tantalising rematch",sports,N/A,Abc,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-20/afl-preliminary-final-collingwood-brisbane-preview/105793028,2025-09-20 00:00:00,"The upcoming preliminary final between Collingwood and Brisbane is a highly anticipated rematch of the thrilling 2023 AFL Grand Final, where Collingwood emerged victorious.

"Video record of violence and racism at Purnim Bears, Noorat country football grand final Loading...

The 1987 Mt Noorat League grand final was meant to be the Purnim Bears' crowning moment. Instead, it became their last.

From premiers to pariahs, the predominantly Indigenous side was expelled from the league after just one season. The video footage that condemned them remained hidden for decades.

Until now.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised this article includes racist and offensive language and images of people who have died.

The dust never had a chance to settle at the Noorat Recreation Reserve. It hung in the spring air, kicked up by battered Commodores and dirt-covered Falcons parked three-deep around the boundary, engines idling as tension rippled through the crowd.

Men lean on bonnets, stubbies in hand, watching a game that threatens to spill beyond the boundary, a match where race and rivalry collide like fists.

The match — captured on amateur video that cleared one side but was hidden from the other — began not with violence, but ceremony.

The anthem warbles from the ground's Tannoy speakers in a fleeting gesture of respect, as a ragged line of footballers stand on the patchy centre wing, socks pulled high and woollen jumpers hanging loose.

But that's where the civility ends.

White paint marks the turf at the centre of this country football oval. ( )

A restless energy grips the crowd as Bears captain-coach Geoff Clark jogs to full forward. He would later become Australia's most powerful Aboriginal voice — and then a convicted fraudster.

Signs of age litter the Noorat Recreation Reserve. ( )

Noorat defender Ken McSween follows in his wake as the crowd leans in.

Tension was high as the central umpire held the ball aloft to start the grand final. ( )

The opening siren blasts.

As the game got under way, no-one could predict its far-reaching consequences. ( )

Even the air seems still as the crowd holds its breath, waiting for the inevitable crunch.

Four minutes in, the first hit lands with a thud.

McSween barrels through Clark with all the subtlety of a freight train.

Elbow. Jaw. Full tilt.

Clark crumples.

Whistle.

A free kick, and a 15-metre penalty for time wasting. Nothing more. Not yet.

""The umpires will need to keep their eye on players today because it could become a bit fiery,"" the commentary drawls on the aged VHS tape.

Clark takes full toll and kicks a goal. First blood to Purnim.

By the final siren, the umpires' book is bursting with 18 charges against six players from the predominantly Indigenous Bears side.

Their Noorat counterparts escape with just bruises from a game some witnesses feared could have turned fatal.

In the days that follow, a reckoning of threats and injustice erupt.

And the grand final tape becomes a weapon.

Not because it cleared the Noorat players, but because the Bears never saw it.

In its grainy frames, the Purnim players are preserved as both victors and villains — champions on paper, casualties in history.

Winners that day; exiled ever after.

The Bears celebrate their first and only grand final win. ( )

Purnim sits about 250 kilometres south-west of Melbourne, a tiny farming town where the rich volcanic soil matters as much as the people who work it.

Ten minutes down the road is the Framlingham Aboriginal Reserve, a densely forested area on the traditional lands of the Kirrae Whurrong people, who were given ownership of the former mission in 1971.

But for all their geographical closeness, residents of the two towns remained largely divided along racial lines.

The Purnim Bears were founded as a race relations exercise between the Aboriginal community at Framlingham and the European community at Purnim.

By that measure, club treasurer Robert Fleming considers the footballing social experiment a success.

""Basically, people started to know one another,"" he says.

Robert Fleming considered himself the ""odd jobs"" man at the Bears. ( )

Robert Fleming keeps a framed picture of the Bears in his home. ( )

The Bears will always be remembered for their one victorious year. ( )

The change was most evident at the town's only pub, where Framlingham residents became people with first names and faces, not just surnames.

""I think we achieved something everybody else said we couldn't,"" he says.

Robert Fleming was the secretary, tribunal advocate and ""odd jobs"" man at the Purnim Bears. ( )

On-field success followed, too.

In their debut year, the Bears swept the Mt Noorat Football League awards.

Tim Chatfield won the league best and fairest award at just 18, while Clark, by this time in the twilight of a decorated footballing career, won the leading goal kicker award.

They had the trophies, the talent, the story.

What they didn't know was that their time was already running out.

Collisions and chaos

Three minutes after their first clash, McSween and Clark are at it again.

This time, it's Clark who storms through with a late spoil, before getting up and swinging a roundhouse at his opponent's chin.

""There's a bit of fireworks there with these two. No love lost between Clark and McSween,"" the commentator calls without a shred of irony.

Ten minutes later, Clark's fist again finds an opponent's face during a marking contest.

A red and white jumper hits the turf.

""Better get the trainer out to him,"" the commentator calls without taking a breath.

Less than a minute passes before the biff continues.

Clark, the No.1 on his back clearly in frame, takes exception to another attempted mark and responds with a left hook more at home in a boxing ring than a footy oval.

The crowd groans as the umpire pursues Clark with a half-hearted warning.

""Play on, that's the way. Don't worry about the fights. Let's get going,"" the commentator calls.

For every hit the tape captures, countless others are missed.

""I got king hit, to be honest with you, in the first quarter,"" Tim Chatfield says.

The teenager was head and shoulders above his opposition and targeted for it.

""In my era there was a lot of it [racist abuse], but it's just about how strong-minded you are as a player.

""It was pretty common back in those days.""

At half-time, the scoreboard reads Purnim 7.8.50 to Noorat 5.8.38.

But there was another tally running, quieter and more dangerous — the umpire's notebook.

Geoff Clark was reported multiple times during the final. ( )

On that count, the Bears were even further ahead.

And one name dominated the entries.

Brothers in arms

Alan Brown wore his Aboriginality with pride when he represented the Bears, his jersey sporting the Aboriginal flag on his right breast.

But he didn't need a flag to remind him of his Kirrae Wurrong heritage — his opponents would do that for him.

""There [was] definitely over-the-top racism. Some of it hateful, hateful language,"" he says.

Alan Brown is still connected with the Fitzroy Stars. ( )

Brown was one of a collection of Melbourne-based players Geoff Clark recruited from the Fitzroy Stars after that side of Indigenous footballers found itself without a league to play in at the end of 1986.

In an ominous moment of foreshadowing, the Fitzroy Stars applied to join 36 other leagues when theirs folded, and were rejected by each one in turn.

He remembers his time with the Purnim Bears fondly.

""We weren't a bunch of thugs running around terrorising the white population of western Victoria. Far from it,"" he says.

""It was great to put the Purnim Bears into the competition but, I mean, they misjudged us.""

Alan Brown is still involved in community football. ( )

Alan Brown is proud of his indigenous heritage. ( )

Alan Brown believes racism was at play in the late 80s. ( )

Brown says the injustices they faced on the field were part and parcel of being Indigenous, even on the traditional lands of his mob in south-west Victoria.

He wasn't surprised when the Mount Noorat League kicked the all-conquering side out after just a year without a reason or an excuse.

""Perhaps their racism fooled them,'"" he says.

""Maybe [they thought] that we're going to be a bunch of easybeats, deadbeats, maybe they underestimated who Aboriginal people are.

""And maybe they said, 'Oh shit, we thought they'd be easybeats just to make up the numbers. Turn up, get flogged,' but that didn't happen,"" he says, with the unmistakable lilt of a smile in his voice.

His brother, Gavin, shared both the Bears' premiership glory and the weight of that experience.

Alan and Gavin Brown travelled from Melbourne to represent Purnim. ( )

He says the way football brought the towns of Purnim and Framlingham together at a time of deep racial divides was unique.

""The cohesion [between Indigenous and non-Indigenous players] was something special,"" Gavin says.

""This might be controversial, but I think even the non-Aboriginal people at the club were frowned on by the broader community for being involved in some respects.

""I can't answer that, only they can. But you could feel there might have been some resentment there.

""Other teams went hard at us. There's no doubt.""

And Alan Brown has one secret he kept from the league for nearly 40 years.

The location of the premiership cup itself.

But more on that later.

Alan Brown has safeguarded a piece of Purnim Bears history. ( )

Swinging fists

Boos rain down on Clark as the match wears on, though the Bears' star forward barely flinches.

A Bronx cheer erupts as the umpire turns him around to take his number after yet another wild hit to McSween.

But perhaps the most brutal moment captured on film — a punch so palpable it stops the commentary cold — has nothing to do with Clark.

Noorat's Mick Reid is flattened by a blow from Joey Bell that elicits a tortured groan from the masses.

The red and white jumper crumples to the turf as players from both sides converge.

""Regrettable incident there,"" the commentator calls, his casual tone jarring against the violence.

Play continues, as does Purnim's dominance, physically and on the scoreboard.

Some hits are captured clearly on tape, others revealed only by the groans and baying of the crowd.

With each blow, the tension builds.

The tape captures more than just the violence.

Indigenous players are referred to only as ""that curly-haired little bloke"", ""brothers"" or ""this boy, Atkinson"".

A reference to hating AFL club Carlton leads to an off-mic comment — ""Syd Jackson!"" — the Indigenous star from a decade earlier, his name thrown around like a slur.

At other times, Clark is referred to simply as ""what's his name"", prompting the commentator to remind those in the box that the tape was to be delivered to ""the Purnim boys as well"".

But it never was.

Trial by media

The Purnim Bears proved an immovable force that day.

By the final siren, the scoreboard read Purnim 20.14 (134) to Noorat 13.13 (91).

The following Monday's Warrnambool Standard landed on doorsteps with a thump rivalling the weekend's hits.

The front page of the Warrnambool Standard the day after the grand final. ( )

""Football Mayhem"" cried the front page headline.

Beneath it detailed the ""unprecedented outbreak"" with ""18 players before tribunal"".

The headline was wrong — it was 18 charges against six players — a mistake that still rankles some former Bears.

The inside coverage wasn't much better.

The Purnim players' Indigenous background was called-out in the inside page coverage. ( )

""The 18 charges — 16 of them against Aboriginal players — range from abusive language to assaulting an umpire and include striking and kicking,"" it reported.

Unnamed sources were given authority.

""Their sensible approach probably saved someone being killed,"" the unnamed person stated about the Noorat players.

Clark, facing five charges, had his right of reply 24 hours later, telling The Standard the hits were retaliatory after he was ""lined up three times"".

The controversy was ""indicative of the way Aboriginal achievement was treated,"" he said.

""If anything, I've come off second best.""

The post-match coverage lasted several days.

Within two days, rival clubs started to threaten a boycott of the Bears.

An anonymous league official offered the harshest verdict:

""You would not treat a dog the way the Purnim players treated the Noorat blokes on Saturday,"" the source stated.

For a week, the match fallout dominated the local paper.

The league, despite mounting pressure, refused to confirm which players were cited or why, allowing rumours to spiral.

One of the umpires, Duncan Potts, received anonymous threats that his home would be burnt down.

The Standard responded to criticism of its coverage with an editorial titled: ""The truth is elusive.""

""In our defence, it must be said that The Standard does not control what happens on a football field … our reports merely reflect events,"" the paper's editor, Richard Goodwin, wrote.

Those events were eventually laid bare in three concurrent tribunal hearings, which The Standard was refused access to.

The broader battle

The Bears' treatment in the late 1980s was far from isolated.

Australian football trailblazers, including Carlton's Syd Jackson and St Kilda's Robbie Muir, endured torrents of racial abuse, including being spat on, urinated on, pelted with bottles and even set upon by mobs.

Club banners carried slurs without challenge. Blatant racism became a tactic.

Bears players copped it all with abuse like ""n****r-lover"" and ""black bastard"" thrown around indiscriminately throughout the year.

A local once remarked to Fleming how ""dark"" training was at Purnim one night — a pointed remark at the players' skin colour.

""Back in those days, players used to get called things like 'c**n' and that,"" Fleming says.

One former Bears player said the insults made him ""ashamed of the [white] culture"".

Nicky Winmar's protest brought racism to the fore. ( )

Just six years later, St Kilda's Nicky Winmar forced the AFL to confront racism by defiantly lifting his jumper and pointing at his skin.

But change was slow.

Indigenous players were told they would get respect if they ""conducted themselves like white people"".

One recruiter said they could be drafted, but only if they had one white parent.

Incessant booing drove Adam Goodes, one of the game's greats, into retirement.

Adam Goodes was the target of racist booing during his twilight years. ( )

The AFL eventually apologised, but the damage was done.

Today, the league positions itself as a watchdog, calling out abuse with catchcries like ""real fans don't racially abuse players"" at a time when the number of Indigenous footballers at the top level is in decline and pervasive abuse on social media continues unchecked.

Jamarra Ugle-Hagan grew up in Framlingham.

In March 2023, under Docklands stadium's stark white lights, Jamarra Ugle-Hagan — who grew up in Framlingham — lifted his shirt and pointed to his skin.

Like Winmar, like so many before him, he answered hate with pride.

The tale of the tape

When the Mt Noorat League tribunal convened in the tiny town of Glenormiston, it resembled a courtroom drama more than a football hearing.

Three hearings ran at once to churn through the mountain of charges.

What became immediately clear was the divide between the haves and have-nots: Noorat had seen the tape, the Bears weren't so lucky.

The front page of the Warrnambool Standard covered the match fall-out. ( )

Clark called it a kangaroo court, railing against what he said was a denial of natural justice.

Fleming, acting as the club representative, said he and Clark were eventually shown small snippets of each reportable offence just minutes before the hearings commenced.

""They took us up to some old TV … and just ran through it for us and said, 'You've seen it [now],'"" he says.

It did little to help their cause.

All six Purnim players were suspended, with Clark receiving the harshest penalty of two years and nine months for four counts of striking and one of kicking.

Allan ""Chad"" Hickey, the sole white player cited, copped 12 weeks for what past players remember as an incidental off-camera collision that somehow turned reportable offence.

""It seemed a fairly clear attempt to put the Bears out of business,"" football historian Dave Nadel wrote in the 1993 Australian Society for Sports History journal.

The Purnim Bears are a part of south-west football folklore. ( )

Bad news bears

In December 1987, the Mt Noorat League took the extraordinary step of expelling its premiers from the competition.

The vote was close but decisive: four to three.

The Warrnambool Standard ran a headline of ""Bears get the boot"". ( )

The Standard led with the alliterative ""Bears get the boot"".

League secretary Alan Field offered no public explanation beyond stating the league had constitutional rights to exclude clubs.

Clark labelled it a racially based decision to scapegoat the Bears for sloppy administration.

His protests fell flat.

The Purnim Bears had seemingly won everything: the premiership, individual awards, the community's respect.

What they couldn't win was the right to defend their victories, let alone bask in them.

More than a game

Standing outside his Terang home, Ken McSween still has the hulk and hobble of an ex-footballer.

These days, the former Noorat defender works in security, still doing what he can to avoid punches.

When you mention the 1987 grand final and his battles with Geoff Clark, something shifts in his expression.

Not quite a wince, but close. A wry smile, perhaps.

Ken McSween is a farmer turned security guard in Terang. ( )

Willow the dog is a constant companion for Ken McSween. ( )

""It was an eerie feeling, actually, standing out on the ground because you weren't quite sure what was going to come sailing over the fence at any point,"" he says.

It didn't take long for that feeling to be justified.

He said Clark, who was playing at full forward, walked up and stood beside him before the first bounce, despite the fact McSween was lining up at centre half back.

""The [Purnim] centre half forward leaned around me and said: 'She's right, Geoff, I've got it,'"" McSween remembers.

""Geoff leans around [in reply] and says: 'Mind your own f***ing business.'""

Ken McSween says he's often asked about the 1987 grand final. ( )

McSween doesn't recall racist remarks on the ground, but he does remember the physicality.

""I was just hit and kicked all through the game. A lot of people said to me, 'Why'd you keep getting up?' and I said, 'Because I had to,'"" he says.

""Some people said I was stupid, [that] they would have lain down from the first punch. That's not me"".

McSween says he was the only player Clark wanted to shake hands with at the end of the match.

The pair continued to run into each other in the years after, with Clark even lacing up his boots for a local match coached by McSween.

For the Noorat veteran, the violence that day started and ended on the field.

It's where he wants it to stay.

The missing voice

The voice most notably absent belongs to Geoff Clark.

Clark's path post-football was improbable, even by the standards of a sport that transforms working-class kids into millionaires.

Geoff Clark was close to Australia's biggest political powers when chair of ATSIC. ( )

Geoff Clark captained at ATSIC XI against a Prime Minister's XI in 2002. ( )

Clark rubbed shoulders with Indigenous football luminaries like Michael Long and Sid Jackson. ( )

But police were watching his financial dealings back at Framlingham.

The community that produced the Bears became the focus of Operation Omega, a fraud investigation targeting the retired footballer.

Clark was a prominent voice in the media in the 90s and 2000s. ( )

Clark would eventually be jailed for six years and two months for defrauding the Framlingham community of just shy of $1 million. He will be eligible for parole in 2028.

The ABC understands Clark is appealing against some of the charges.

But for all the time that's passed, divisions remain.

A decade before the Bears' inauguration, he would walk to Warrnambool and back — a 56km round trip — three times a week to train and play because his non-Indigenous teammates wouldn't give him a lift.

""We copped it on a regular basis: my sons, myself when I was playing. It was just seen to be the 'in thing' back then,"" he says.

He remembers the Bears like a meteor — a flash of brilliance that brought divided communities together, before vanishing again.

""All of a sudden, it virtually split both communities again,"" Lowe says of the Bears' eviction.

""I don't think they're as close now as it was back then.""

Purnim is still a salt-of-the-earth farming town, though its population has dwindled to less than 300.

The Mt Noorat Football League merged with the nearby Heytesbury league in 1992, before folding 10 years later.

Noorat still plays at the Recreation Reserve, now as the Power after a merger with the neighbouring town of Kolora.

But Purnim has been without a side since the Bears' dramatic departure in 1987.

"Does the damning planning report mean the end for Hobart's Macquarie Point stadium? It's a town-planning exercise of immense complexity.

A roofed stadium at the intersection of Hobart's only major arterial routes, on the edge of a heritage waterfront CBD, in a city with limited public transport, tight time frames and at a time of budget pressure.

The Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) was scathing of the proposed Macquarie Point stadium in its draft report on March 31 — and over the coming six months, most of these concerns remain.

The final report today — recommending against the stadium — was almost just as scathing.

""This report is not unexpected,"" Premier Jeremy Rockliff said.

The panel has provided a level of scrutiny that might not have otherwise occurred, and Mr Rockliff says it is now in the hands of the parliament to decide.

The TPC report will help to guide this decision.

Why did the TPC reject the stadium?

The TPC had three main problems with the stadium: its size and location, its poor urban planning and the cost on Tasmania's budget with limited returns.

On the first point, the TPC described the stadium as a ""singular, large, bulky monolith"" that overwhelms the surrounding buildings and does not flow with Hobart's mountain-river landscape.

Before and after: See what effect proposed AFL stadium has on Hobart cityscape Photo shows A before and after composite of a stadium in Hobart. Take a look at how the multipurpose stadium is expected to look once complete.

On the second, it does not activate the land for other uses and creates an isolated precinct, while questions are unanswered about public transport, pedestrian use, car reliance and a traffic ""shock wave"".

And the third — potentially the most scathing — was the upfront cost, amount of debt and repayments, poor economic returns and broader impact on Tasmania's public services as a result.

The project of state significance process effectively ""turns off"" planning laws, so these are seen as advice for parliament — and the advice is a resounding ""no"".

Loading

Is the stadium now dead?

No.

The government changed laws last year to allow the parliament to have the final say on the project of state significance process.

Mr Rockliff intends to introduce an ""order"" to parliament by the end of this year to approve the stadium, incorporating the feedback from the TPC and from his earlier enabling legislation to attach conditions.

Labor has given unconditional support for the stadium, but now say they will ""take their time"" to consider the report.

If it has Labor's support, the order will pass the lower house, and will then require the support of three out of eight independents in the upper house to be approved.

Of those eight, Meg Webb, Ruth Forrest, Mike Gaffney and Rosemary Armitage are opposed.

It means the government will be lobbying Tania Rattray, Dean Harriss, Bec Thomas and Casey Hiscutt to support the stadium.

Graphic of the ""key design features"" of the proposed Macquarie Point stadium, taken from Enabling Legislation Report Consultation Draft, Hobart, May 2025. (Tasmanian government)

Has the cost increased?

Yes.

The first estimate was $715 million in late 2022, then it increased to $775 million in 2024 after a design update, and again to $945 million in May this year.

This has increased to $1.13 billion today.

The TPC estimates the public loan at the end of the construction period will be $1 billion, which grows to $1.8 billion over 10 years due to interest.

The TPC says the construction will cost each Tasmanian household $4,100, and that $50 million per year would need to be recovered in taxes.

How will it be paid for?

The Tasmanian government has promised to cap its spend at $375 million in ""capital"" costs.

The Commonwealth has committed $240 million to the Macquarie Point precinct, rather than specifically for the stadium, and requires a plan that includes housing.

The AFL will provide $15 million — while also adding significantly more for overall grassroots football support.

The rest comes through debt, with the Tasmanian government choosing not to pursue a public-private partnership.

Loading...

But won't it make money?

A KPMG report, prepared for the government-owned Macquarie Point Development Corporation, estimated a cost-benefit ratio of 0.69.

The TPC report estimates it will be 0.45 — so for every $1 spent, it gains 45 cents.

There is then a disagreement over whether there are additional economic benefits from a stadium that were not quantified in these estimates.

The TPC said there was ""optimism bias"" in the government's cost-benefit figures, while Mr Rockliff said the TPC had ""massively underestimated"" the economic returns.

Stadiums are big. Why is this a problem for Hobart?

The TPC describes Hobart as having a ""natural layered landform"" from kunanyi/Mount Wellington down to the River Derwent, and the waterfront as ""the centre of the amphitheatre"".

The Macquarie Point stadium will dominate the Hobart skyline. (Supplied: MPDC)

There are relatively few large buildings, and none near the scale and bulk of a stadium.

""It is the combination of the size, bulk and location of the stadium that cause it to be discordant with its surrounds, to such an extent as to overwhelm and disrespect them,"" the TPC report reads.

Other states have built new stadiums; can't Tasmania follow their examples?

The Tasmanian government regularly points to Optus Stadium in Perth, the Townsville Stadium and Adelaide Oval as examples of recent stadium developments that have broad public support.

What we learnt from the Macquarie Point stadium hearings Photo shows Model of a proposed stadium. Tasmania's Planning Commission is assessing the proposed Macquarie Point AFL stadium. Here's what it heard during the past fortnight's hearings.

Parliamentarians even went on a recent tour of Adelaide Oval.

But the TPC argues that Hobart has substantially different urban challenges, while it lacks the established public transport links of other cities.

""Unlike successful examples of city stadiums, such as Adelaide Oval or the MCG, there is inadequate space at the Macquarie Point site to mitigate the city-scale negative effects of visual bulk and homogeneity,"" the report reads.

Will it still have a roof?

Yes.

But the proposed domed translucent roof did not escape criticism from the TPC either.

Its size, height and level of translucency of the chosen material — ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) pillows — is still subject to change.

""The nominated ETFE material is reflective to at least some extent and in different light conditions, and will appear relatively luminous, not recessive,"" the report reads.

"" In its setting, this will increase its perceived size. ""

How will people get to the stadium?

The government estimates that 30 to 40 per cent of people will travel by car, and the remainder by bus, ferry or walking.

There could also be park-and-ride facilities built in places like Claremont, Huntingfield and Geilston Bay, but there are no firm plans.

The TPC describes the government's mass passenger ideas as ""largely conceptual and aspirational"".

The bus mall at the stadium still needs to be designed, while Metro Tasmania is continuing to face issues in attracting drivers, let alone staffing for 80 additional event buses.

There was also the potential to geo-block ride share services like Uber to prevent drivers from ""circling at low speeds"" and stopping in traffic lanes.

Corporate patrons, however, will have access to 300 parks in the stadium's underground car park.

Will it create much traffic?

The stadium is proposed for the confluence of the Brooker Highway, Tasman Highway and Macquarie/Davey streets — the only major route through Hobart.

Before and after events, streets and lanes will need to be closed, the report notes.

The closure of Davey Street during a Dark Mofo parade gridlocked the Brooker Highway, while a truck crash on the Tasman Bridge in 2023 saw traffic jams rapidly spread through suburbs.

""The Hobart CBD traffic network is not resilient and is prone to unplanned incidents creating 'shock waves' of congestion and gridlock through the network,"" the TPC report said.

Has the government resolved safety issues for pedestrians?

The draft TPC report raised a range of concerns about pedestrian safety, the potential for pinch points, and emergency evacuations.

This stems from a large amount of patrons needing to walk on narrow footpaths alongside busy arterial roads, and being funnelled through a waterfront precinct.

A pedestrian overpass on Collins Street is still being considered, along with the widening of footpaths on Davey Street and temporary barriers along the Tasman Highway.

The TPC saw issues as manageable, but would require significant event-day planning and resourcing.

Isn't there meant to be housing too?

Yes, in order to obtain $240 million in Commonwealth funding.

The TPC continues to describe the proposed housing as isolated and a poor urban design outcome.

Specific plans have not been released, but the Tasmanian government says a draft plan has been presented to the Commonwealth and could be finalised by the end of this year.

Do people actually want the stadium?

Despite the level of public interest in Tasmania, there has been almost no reliable public polling.

This week, the Tasmania Devils released results from an online ""survey"" which it said pointed to support for the stadium from several younger demographics.

Polling analyst Kevin Bonham extrapolated the data to reach an overall result of 38 per cent support, 49 per cent oppose, but was critical of the survey's methodology.

He said the best polling on the topic was by EMRS in February this year, which resulted in 36 per cent support and 59 per cent opposed.",Does the damning planning report mean the end for Hobart's Macquarie Point stadium?,sports,N/A,Abc,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-17/is-hobart-stadium-now-dead-explainer/105780834,2025-09-17 00:00:00,"The Tasmanian Planning Commission has recommended against the proposed Macquarie Point stadium in Hobart, citing concerns over its size, location, urban planning issues, and significant financial implications for the state.

"Leaving the AFL: When the Australian dream becomes a nightmare A photo of Eagles premiership player Adam Hunter as a kid. ( )

To compete at the highest level of AFL requires sacrifice from a young age.

Adam Hunter celebrates his goal for the Eagles during a 2006 final against Sydney. ( )

The pay-offs are high — an enviable salary and the chance to live out the dream of thousands of Australian kids.

But the threat of injury or delisting always hovers around the corner, and even the best and most fortunate of players cannot last past 40.

Former AFL players have told the ABC just how brutal the transition out of professional football can be. ( )

So what happens when the dream ends?

With the recent deaths of several former AFL stars putting a spotlight on the physical and mental health of those who leave the sport, ex-players and their families have told the ABC just how brutal the transition out of professional football can be.

The parents of late AFL player Adam Hunter can recall the injuries he sustained over his career as if they are scars on their own bodies.

It is the image of him getting carried off an oval, shaking and convulsing after a head knock, that sticks with his step-dad Rod Brown the most.

But in recent years it had been getting harder to watch.

After injury forced him to retire from the AFL, Hunter, who died earlier this year aged 43, had rejoined his old team South Bunbury in the South West Football League (SWFL).

Brown said opposition players and spectators targeted the premiership player from the get-go.

Adam Hunter's mum and step-dad Joanne and Rod Brown say the premiership player was unfairly targeted by opposition punters and players when he returned to his local league. ( )

A 21-year-old Adam Hunter, bandaged and battered, sits down in the change rooms after losing the 2002 elimination final. ( )

Hunter leaves the Kardinia Park playing field with blood coming from his head in 2006 after he was pushed into the interchange bench. ( )

""The grand final he played in down here for South Bunbury, the first five minutes he was taken off the field with a gash over his eye that required about eight stitches,"" he said.

""I think it's a bit of a tall poppy syndrome. You always get that person that just wants to say 'I punched Adam Hunter'.

""But he's not out there to prove anything … He just wanted to play football.""

Brown said the same thing had happened at pretty much every club his step-son had played at since he retired.

He said they had begged him to stop playing football, concerned for his health.

""It was always 'just one more year',"" he said.

""Maybe it's the high of winning a premiership … He just loved the game that much. It was his life.""

Brown said it pained him and his wife, Hunter's mother Joanne, particularly when Hunter's young son, Reef, was with them watching on, confused by the ""vulgar"" and ""disrespectful"" comments spectators were making about his dad.

But he said there was no other option in Hunter's mind — he had given everything to football and was in it for the long haul.

Hunter was still battling the shoulder injury that ended his AFL career and, according to his parents, was aware he likely had chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) from countless head knocks and concussions.

Results from a neuropathology report on Hunter's brain — donated by his parents to the Australian Sports Brain Bank — have confirmed his fears, identifying several lesions consistent with stage II CTE.

Trainers attend to Adam Hunter after a collision in an intra-club AFL match in 2007. ( )

Preliminary coronial findings indicate Hunter ultimately died from methylamphetamine-related heart failure.

Inquiries into the circumstances surrounding his death remain ongoing.

Glorified gladiators

Brown said because players like Hunter had lived out the Australian dream and earned a lot of money to do so, some people seemed to think they deserved to be brought down a peg.

""I hear people say, 'oh, he got $250,000 a year' … But mate, you don't have to go to work and break a leg or dislocate a shoulder,"" he said.

""You can't wear this, you can't do that, you can't eat this, you can't go there … The blood, sweat and tears those boys put in, it's something else.

""They're glorified gladiators basically.""

Brown said he wished amateur leagues called out spectator behaviour more regularly as they had started doing at the AFL level.

SWFL president Barry Tate said he was aware of AFL players being disproportionately targeted when they returned to amateur leagues.

He said Hunter played hard but probably got targeted more than he should have been.

However, he said the league never received any formal complaints from South Bunbury Football Club.

""In a lot of ways they do [get targeted] because they're obviously high-profile people,"" Tate said.

""They should just come back and enjoy it and players should respect other players who've been there and done that.

""[Hunter] obviously had nothing to prove because he won a premiership and played over 150 games for the West Coast Eagles.""

The final straw

All ex-Collingwood defender Jason Cloke wanted to do when he left the AFL was go back to playing footy for fun.

But after being hospitalised over a dozen times and countless concussions, the 43-year-old has hung up his boots.

""They think you're entitled to cop it and you should be able to cop it because you're an ex-AFL footballer,"" he said.

""A lot of umpires even will go out of their way and pretty much tell you 'I'm not going to give a free kick to you, I can't stand you, I can't stand your family'.""

Jason Cloke injured face ( )

Former Collingwood player Jason Cloke says he has been hospitalised more than a dozen times after being injured in amateur football games. ( )

Cloke and his two brothers — Cameron and Travis — are the sons of decorated 333-gamer David Cloke, and were all drafted by Collingwood under the father-son rule.

He said the Magpies were widely disliked by fans of other clubs, while the black-and-white army still resented him for getting suspended right before the 2002 grand final, which they lost.

He said many thought because they paid a membership they owned the players forever, and it is not just ex-footballers who cop undue aggression in amateur leagues.

""It's anyone that's got a profile … They just want to hit you. They just want to be the one that tackles you … [they] don't even look at the ball,"" he said.

Cloke, who now works as a carpenter, said things improved after he left the Melbourne bubble and joined a Masters League in Queensland.

But when an opposition player punched him in the face in a game last year while play was paused, leaving him hospitalised once again, it was the final straw.

Cloke said after so many head knocks, the idea he could be suffering from CTE weighed heavily on his mind.

""I struggle to get off the couch some days,"" he said.

""You get in the car sometimes and you're driving and you're trying to go somewhere and you're like … 'where am I going? What am I doing?'.

""It's all the time, and you don't know if it's football-related or if you're just getting older.""

Cloke said he missed playing and the companionship of teammates but he now could not look at a football oval without thinking about getting punched.

""You Google my name now the first thing that comes up pretty much is getting king hit. That's what my legacy is now, getting king hit in local footy,"" he said.

According to Cloke, his brother Cameron continued to be targeted playing country football in Victoria, while Travis lost his love of the game far earlier after a long career that finished in injury and criticism.

Last week, former Collingwood AFLW star Moana Hope recently called out the ""vile and disgusting"" verbal abuse she copped from both opposition players and the crowd during a qualifying finals clash in the Essendon Districts Football League in Victoria.

She said she was worried for the safety of her kids who were watching on.

The league said any form of anti-social behaviour was ""completely unacceptable"" and confirmed it was investigating the allegations.

League president calls for end to aggression

Queensland Masters Football league president Samuel French said it was ""disappointing"" to see players like Cloke drop out due to unnecessary on-field aggression.

He said the league was keen to attract AFL players as they helped boost the game's profile in a rugby league state.

""We want ex-AFL players to come and play for fun,"" he said.

""They shouldn't have a target on them. Unfortunately it seems that in some instances they do.""

French said the player who hit Cloke had received the equivalent of a lifetime ban.

Queensland Masters league president Sam French says they are cracking down on aggressive behaviour on-field and off-field from both players and spectators. ( )

He said the league was making a concerted effort to crack down on aggressive behaviour after ""a horrendous amount of suspensions"" in 2024.

""Unfortunately that 35 to 45 age group is still ultra-competitive … [and] they haven't quite accepted that they're not as good as they were in their 20s,"" he said.

""Until you accept that it's not fun, because you're just really angry because you want to do better but your body simply will not let you do that.""

French said this year had seen a marked improvement in suspensions but there was still a way to go, including addressing poor spectator behaviour.

""Mum's don't want to bring their kids because there's a lot of bad language and things like that,"" he said.

""We're committed to making it better.""

Starting over

Recent AFL retiree Dyson Heppell said while he had seen other former players ""smashed from pillar to post"" when they returned to lower leagues, he had been fortunate to have so far been welcomed.

The former Bomber returned to the VFL with Port Melbourne this year and even headed home to play a few games in Leongatha.

""The boys that I've played against have been incredible,"" he said.

Dyson Heppell leaves the field for the last time in the AFL, after retiring at the end of the 2025 season. ( )

""Some of them have been mad Essendon fans and fans of mine, so even getting pictures with opposition players post-game has been really funny and really nice.

""Just to play footy for the pure fun of it was incredible.""

But Heppell said leaving the AFL was still a unique and often lonely challenge.

Through its annual surveys, the AFL Players Association has consistently found former players struggle with the transition.

It identified that delisted players often reported significantly worse transition experiences compared to retiring players.

Heppell said while he was one of the lucky ones — seeing out a decorated 14-year career with the club he loved — the past 12 months had been harder than expected.

Dyson Heppell of the Bombers gestures to fans during the round 23 AFL match between Essendon Bombers and Sydney Swans at Docklands, on August 16, 2024, in Melbourne, Australia. ( )

""It's a difficult transition to know that you've reached the absolute pinnacle of your sport that you possibly could … and then all of a sudden that will never be the case again,"" he said.

""There's nothing that will ever replace the feeling of running out in front of 100,000 fans, the adoration that you get … the feeling of a tremendous win post-game in the rooms and sharing that with your teammates.""

Heppell said he was on a road trip with his partner when this reality properly hit.

""I just burst into tears … There was moment of grieving that footy was finished … but also a moment of relief,"" he said.

""I need to come to terms and accept that … this next period is going to be difficult because everything that I've known for my entire life is now finished.""

Heppell said he had the advantage of prior experience, having been forced to take a break from football during Essendon's drug saga.

""Footy's not everything, you know, I learnt that back then in 2016 in that year off, knowing there's so much more to life and more things to look forward to as well,"" he said.

Heppell said he was redirecting his energy towards the clothing label he started with his partner Kate and 13-year-old Harrison Pennicott, who has a rare form of the autoimmune disease scleroderma.

The label is helping raise money for the young teen to tick items off his bucket list.

"ABC Sport's Andrew Moore recounts 'miracle survival' after cardiac arrest that led to four operations Andrew Moore never misses a flight, so when the ABC Sport commentator was late for the plane the morning after calling a Storm game in Melbourne, it may have been the first warning sign.

After driving to Newcastle for the round 23 NRL Friday game, former 2GB radio colleague and rugby league great Steve Roach checked in, saying he had ""never seen [Moore] look so tired"".

Moore said he felt ""off"" on the Sunday commentating at Parramatta Stadium, and called in sick the next day.

On the morning of Wednesday, August 13, he woke up with chest pains, describing it as feeling like a series of progressively heavier weights being placed on his chest.

""My mind was playing weird games with me and putting me through this almost profound questionnaire,"" Moore told his ABC Sport radio colleagues in an emotional interview.

""I had to keep answering these questions before asking [wife] Janyne to call the ambulance.""

Paramedics diagnosed a heart attack and rushed Moore to Westmead Hospital for coronary and cardiac care, where he underwent an initial three-hour surgery to place stents — tubes used to hold arteries open and improve blood flow to the heart muscle.

""I didn't realise the extent of the heart attack until a few days later when every doctor would come in and it would go from a 'massive' heart attack to a 'miracle survival' heart attack,"" Moore said.

""I only found out when I was cleared of being in imminent danger that I had a 20 per cent chance of surviving. That was humbling.""

During his three weeks in hospital, Moore underwent four operations, but perhaps the most frightening moments came after he was moved to the coronary ward after about five days in intensive care.

'I'm not dying here in front of them'

After asking to sit up so he could look out a window for the first time since arriving in the hospital almost a week earlier, Moore had breakfast before taking his dose of medications for the day.

Despite the nurse's request for ""no surprises"" on his first day in the ward, Moore struggled to get the last few pills down.

""The next thing I knew, I was woken up by the paddles on my chest with a bolt of light,"" he recalled.

""I heard [the doctor] say 'clear' and then I felt the jolt and saw these bright lights.""

Moore remembered the feeling of the chest compressions took the moment from feeling like an out-of-body experience to a realisation that ""this is me, this is real"".

As the doctor asked for someone else to continue CPR, a woman in the room cried out, ""he's conscious, he's conscious, he's conscious"".

""That was scary as hell,"" Moore said through tears.

""I ended up having four of those episodes … I'd go from perfectly conscious to unconscious, and it happened three times in front of my family.

""That hurt. In a rare show of strength, I said, 'I'm not dying here in front of them.'""

All four of those episodes happened over the course of about 24 hours, and Moore paid tribute to ""the amazing medical minds"" at the hospital for saving him and figuring out how to stop them.

A surprising silver lining

Since then — over the course of multiple procedures, blood clots, delays, blood-pressure concerns, and even a diabetes diagnosis — Moore has slowly started to feel more like himself.

He spent three-and-a-half weeks in hospital and was only allowed to stand for two days during that time.

""I feel weak, but I don't feel crook,"" he said after getting out.

During his time in hospital, he also reconnected with his brother, who drove up from Canberra for their first face-to-face meeting in over a decade. His sister was a constant presence and he was visited regularly by his elderly parents and his kids, Archie and Eliza.

All the while, his wife was a rock.

""After the cardiac arrest, I was scared to sleep because of what I was seeing behind the eyelids,"" he said.

""So poor Janyne had to sleep next to me in the ward for about 10 nights in a row.""

Moore said he was more than overwhelmed and bolstered by all the messages of support from friends, family, and strangers that he is still yet to sift through.

""And the nursing staff at Westmead, they are angels,"" he said.

""The connection you get in an eight-hour shift when things are going rough is the most intense relationship ever. I'll remember them forever.""

Moore returned home on Friday to a house decorated with balloons and banners by Eliza, two days before Father's Day.

He will spend weeks recovering and aims to get back to calling footy once he is strong enough, but admitted he has ""no idea when"" that will be.

Moore said he was surprised by the strength he had within him to keep fighting.

""I am [proud], but as anyone who's been through something serious [will tell you], you don't have a choice,"" he said.

""When anything was going to happen, whatever medical procedure, I was proud of the way I could just focus.

""I was proud of the way I didn't dwell on death when it was clearly an option. I'm proud of myself. I'm obviously a lot stronger internally than I thought.

""I'm proud of the strength I've shown, but I'm gonna be more proud of the way I recover and get stronger again and live the rest of my life.

""It's gonna be a massive change, but I'm oddly excited about that.

"Adelaide 36ers terminate Montrezl Harrell's contract amid China doping case The Adelaide 36ers have terminated star import Montrezl Harrell's contract after he was found to have used a prohibited substance while playing in China.

Harrell, who was already serving a provisional ban, was found to have used the substance while playing for the Xinjiang Flying Tigers in China during the National Basketball League (NBL) off-season.

The star import — who joined the 36ers in September 2024 after more than 500 games in the NBA — had just re-signed with the 36ers in May.

The NBL club said Harrell was tested in April 2025, and a positive finding was announced two months later, shortly after he had re-signed for the 36ers.

The club said it was ""disappointed to part ways"" but was left with ""no option"" after the provisional ban.

""As it stands, Harrell is not permitted to train or play,"" the 36ers said in a statement.

""And with no timeline on when the process will be finalised and no certainty on any sanctions, the club has been left with no option but to terminate Harrell's contract to allow it to move to finalise the playing roster.""

The 36ers said they would search for a replacement player. (ABC News: Che Chorley)

The 36ers said the matter in China was ongoing and they could not comment further because of the ""confidentiality policies of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)"".

"Nicho Hynes shrugs off personal barbs ahead of NRL preliminary final between Melbourne and Cronulla Accused by some of being too nice and not nice enough by others, polarising Cronulla star Nicho Hynes ""doesn't give a rats"" about criticism that comes his way anymore.

Arriving in Melbourne as the Sharks look to upset the Storm in Friday night's preliminary final at AAMI Park, Hynes is again in the headlines — this time for his ""salty"" attitude.

The veteran halfback, who played three seasons with Melbourne before shifting to Cronulla in 2022, has dismissed the personal criticism as ""noise"".

The enduring legacy of the 2023 grand final Photo shows A man scores a try during a rugby league match, while another from the opposite team kneels behind. On Sunday, the Broncos and Panthers will face off in the finals for the first time since the 2023 grand final, but the memory of that night still hangs over both sides.

""I just worry about what my teammates and coaches need from me and external noise is external noise — I don't see it, I don't hear it,"" Hynes said.

""I couldn't give a rats about what people say about me … there's nothing left they can say more about me because it's already been said.""

He said he will always defend his Sharks ""family"", which was why he has become more outspoken of late after previously being a media darling for his openness around his mental health and as an Indigenous advocate.

""If someone disses your family I think anyone would go out of their way to say something and speak up about it,"" said the 29-year-old Wiradjuri man.

""I take things personally when people try and diss my family.

""Maybe I've just had enough of it over the last few years with people disrespecting the Sharks. I'll fight for the Sharks until I stop wearing these jerseys.""

The 2022 Dally M Medallist was irked by a perceived lack of respect shown towards his team, who had won just one of six finals games across the last three seasons prior to this year.

In 2025, they finished fifth, then eliminated the Sydney Roosters and minor premiers Canberra en route to the preliminary final.

They have also won nine of their last 10 matches, dropping only one game since their last trip to Melbourne where they were thumped 30-6 by the Storm.

He admitted they had used criticism of the team as motivation for their early finals campaign and are now happy to let their results speak for themselves.

""I'm not in it to prove it to anyone, I'm just in it to prove ourselves — we deserve to be here and we wouldn't be here if we didn't,"" Hynes said.

""The respect, that's all other people's opinions and obviously we've probably used that a little bit in that first final with motivation, but at the moment I just want to get the job done for the team.

""If you get the job done that's how you earn respect.""

Hynes's opposite Jahrome Hughes will enter the match with just one game under his belt in the past two months — the Kiwi Test number seven breaking his arm in a round-27 return from a shoulder dislocation.

Still good friends with many of the Storm players, Hynes described Hughes as a ""tough little bugger"".

Having been in the Storm system, he knows how they would approach an injured player if the tables were turned.

""I know exactly what they would be doing and I'd be making 50 tackles,"" Hynes said.

""Every halfback is a target, I'm a target, I'm making 30-plus tackles a game at the moment and we're not going to shy away from him.

""We've got to worry about a lot of players on the field and target a lot of players, not just Jahrome Hughes.""

"Growing AFL fan club for people with disability helps forge friendships Karen Cronin was on a camping trip watching an AFL match with her son, Jacob Cozens, when she had an idea that would transform his life.

She saw a group of young men socialising, and wished her son was having the same experience.

""My heart broke a little bit for him,"" she said.

""He shouldn't have been sitting there with us … we believe he needed to be social with other people.""

John and Karen Cronin are thrilled Jacob Cozens (centre) has found friends with similar interests. (ABC News: Alice Walker)

The 28-year-old Albury man lives with autism, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability — and supports almost every AFL team.

""Fifteen AFL men's teams,"" Mr Cozens confirmed.

He is known to wear merchandise from multiple clubs at once, and dreams of visiting every AFL football ground.

Ms Cronin realised that passion could be a window to a new social network: an AFL fan club.

""Growing up with Jacob, we often didn't get the invitations to the parties,"" she said.

"" He didn't have friendships outside of his disability support network — I needed to do something. ""

An inclusive party

Ms Cronin approached her son's disability support service employer for permission to use an existing venue designed for people with disabilities, and started getting the word out about a new club.

The idea was to create a relaxed, supervised space where people with disabilities could socialise without explicitly working towards goals in their NDIS plans.

There is no obligation to RSVP, and numbers vary for each AFL Fan Club gathering. (ABC News: Alice Walker)

""We started off with three people, we didn't know how it was going to go,"" Ms Cronin said.

"" Within five minutes there was high-fiving, the guys were getting together, they watched football, they were smiling. ""

From that first gathering seven years ago, the AFL Fan Club has grown to attract as many as 50 people.

Karen Cronin plans to register the AFL Fan Club as a charity. (ABC News: Alice Walker)

Learning skills

According to the 2021 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, people with disability are twice as likely to experience social isolation.

Mr Cozens meets most days with support workers, who assist him with social challenges and work towards independent living.

Respect Support Services co-director Adrian Hoffmann said Mr Cozens could become overwhelmed in the community.

""He doesn't always know how to interact with some people,"" Mr Hoffmann said.

""We encourage him to interact with members of the public, with cashiers to select food from menus … he's come a long way.""

Adrian Hoffmann has been working with Jacob Cozens for about five years. (ABC News: Alice Walker)

Mr Cozens's love of AFL is well known by his support team.

""It's off the charts,"" Mr Hoffmann said.

""Jacob would be at the footy every weekend if he could.""

Skills in practice

There are no memberships for the fan club, just an open invitation to get together every few weeks and enjoy the football and company.

Brook's promotion suggests that Pope's place as number three is under threat after a long period of mixed form. Jacob Bethell, who is yet to score a first-class century, is the most likely candidate to replace him, but Will Jacks is an outside pick.

The spinning all-rounder was a surprise choice as back-up twirler to Shoaib Bashir having previously been mostly considered for the white-ball set-up.

Jacks took six wickets in Rawalpindi on his Test debut in December 2022, did not add to that tally in his next appearance at Multan and had appeared to slip out of England's red-ball plans entirely.

In the intervening period, England have picked six other spinners including Bashir, even dragging Moeen Ali out of retirement to plug a gap during the 2023 Ashes.

Now, after three first-class appearances delivering five wickets this season, Jacks is back in contention because, like Bashir, he has the height England believe makes spinners effective in Australia.

He is also a fine fielder and versatile batter but is currently nursing a broken finger and will miss next month's pre-Ashes white-ball tour of New Zealand to complete his recovery.

Also needing to prove their fitness are Bashir, who broke a finger in the fourth Test with India, Wood, who missed the entire northern summer after a knee operation, and the captain Ben Stokes himself, who also missed the last India Test with a shoulder problem.

The England and Wales Cricket Board said Stokes ""remains on track to be available for the start of the Test series"" but there is a doubt about his fitness to fully contribute as a bowler. If he is unable to play any of the Tests Jacks may well take the all-rounder role with Bashir axed.

In addition, Archer is two Tests into his comeback after four years of setbacks, Brydon Carse has been troubled by a long-standing toe issue, and Gus Atkinson missed the first four Tests against India with a hamstring injury.

With five Tests in seven weeks, starting in Perth on November 21, keeping bowlers fit could be key to who wins. Australia have their own problems with captain Pat Cummins a doubt for the first Test with a back problem.

"Pat Cummins hints at Ashes strategy amid recovery from back injury with 'starting aim' of playing in all five Tests Australia captain Pat Cummins is aiming to play all five men's Ashes Tests, but the injured quick will only know if it is a realistic option closer to the series.

Cummins's fitness is set to dominate the build-up to the Ashes, with 32-year-old nursing a lower-back injury.

He has fronted media three times this month since news broke of the injury: first at a Cricket Australia event a fortnight ago and last week at a sponsorship announcement.

On Friday, it was one of Cummins's passionate projects that brought him out, with $50 million in federal government funding announced for sporting clubs to deal with climate change while also remaining environmentally sustainable.

At each event, he has been unable to offer much news on his injury.

Aussies refusing to panic over Cummins's injury Photo shows Pat Cummins looks over his left shoulder at an Australian training session. Australia coach Andrew McDonald is confident injured captain Pat Cummins will be fit to play a major role in the men's Ashes series.

Eyebrows were raised earlier this week when Australia coach Andrew McDonald said Cummins would ""partake"" in the series, with the first Test against England starting in Perth on November 21.

And while McDonald added later in the same interview Cummins would have a ""significant"" part in the Ashes, he indicated playing five Tests was not the plan.

Cummins, though, said he remained hopeful.

He is unlikely to play a warm-up match before the Ashes, but could join Australia's ODI squad in the lead-up to work with medical staff.

Cummins said five Tests could still be an option after playing through the past two home summers without needing a rest.

""The aim is five. Every summer you kind of aim for five,"" he said.

""This one might be a little bit different because you're coming in a little bit different than other ones. But the starting aim is for five.

""Once we get closer, we're probably going to chat through potentially more realistic situations.

""It's honestly too far out to say, but the aim at the moment is to try and be ready for all of it.""

Bowlers set to be rotated

Cummins pointed to the fact there were eight-day gaps built into the schedule for the first three Tests as to why backing up might not be an issue.

But he also said it was unlikely Australia would stick with an unchanged bowling attack throughout the series.

""Most years, at least one of the bowlers normally goes down,"" Cummins said.

""Joshy [Hazlewood] missed the back-half last year.

""Obviously conditions change, but I think that you just need that fresh bowler, guys that can come in and bowl 40 overs without really blinking in a Test match.""

"Australia loses second ODI to India by record runs margin ahead of Women's Cricket World Cup Australia's all-conquering women's side has been given a wake-up call ahead of their ODI World Cup defence, as India handed them the biggest 50-over loss by runs in the team's history.

Captain Alyssa Healy herself admitted the champions had been ""outplayed"" in New Chandigarh as they suffered a 102-run loss, a thumping so heavy that it surpassed the Australians' previous record 92-run defeat to England in Birmingham 52 years ago.

It was a warning for the team with the World Cup starting in less than a fortnight in India and Sri Lanka, while also setting up a fascinating ODI series decider on Saturday in Delhi with the series locked at 1-1.

Imperious opener Smriti Mandhana was India's hero in the first women's ODI win in India over Australia in 18 years and 206 days.

Mandhana hammered 117, featuring 14 boundaries and four sixes, off just 91 balls in the total of 292.

Australia had chased down a total of 7-281 comfortably in the first match at New Chandigarh, but this time — asked to pull off their highest ever chase — never really got going as Annabel Sutherland's 45 off 42 balls and Ellyse Perry's 44 off 61 proved their most significant contributions in a total of 190.

Healy had won the toss and inserted the home side in baking conditions, and it backfired.

Australia's biggest losses by runs in Women's ODIs 102 runs vs India in New Chandigarh — Sept 17, 2025

92 runs vs England in Birmingham — July 28, 1973

88 runs vs India in Chennai — Dec 28, 2004

84 runs vs South Africa in North Sydney — Feb 7, 2024

82 runs vs New Zealand in Lincoln — Mar 9, 2008

""I mean, it's good preparation for the World Cup, isn't it? You don't get to choose every time,"" she said.

""So no regrets, not really. I just thought India were pretty good today in all facets of the game, and we probably got outplayed a little bit, but it's good to have these opportunities heading into do-or-die World Cup matches.""

Australia lacked the spark that Phoebe Litchfield had provided in the opening match with her sizzling innings of 88, as she missed the match with a low-grade quad strain.

Her replacement, Georgia Voll, was bowled out for a duck by Renuka Singh in the first over, and Australia then got bogged down amid some fine bowling by Kranti Goud, who got the key wicket of Healy (9) amid her haul of 3-29.

Earlier, Mandhana had been severe on Australia's attack, and had it not been for the accurate off-spin of Ash Gardner, the target would have been even higher.

Gardner took 2-39 in her 10 overs, the only Aussie bowler to concede less than four an over.

Young fast bowler Darcie Brown was also impressive, taking three late wickets (3-42) as India went on a late charge.

Tahlia McGrath enjoyed a good day in the field, dismissing Mandhana and running out Goud, but when the all-rounder got caught for 16 off the spin of Deepti Sharma, who took 2-24 to go with a breezy knock of 40, Australia's hopes were sunk.

"Gisborne football netball club members hit back with legal threat after AFL rejects league switch A regional football and netball club president has threatened legal action against AFL Victoria for knocking back the club's request to switch to a different league.

The Gisborne Football Netball Club members voted overwhelmingly in late August for the club to leave the Bendigo league and move to the Ballarat league for next season.

The club wanted to move leagues because several teams in the Ballarat competition, such as Darley, Sunbury and Melton, were all much closer to Gisborne.

But, on Tuesday, AFL Victoria rejected the club's request.

Held to ransom

Gisborne president Tony Brancatisano said remaining in the Bendigo league was ""not viable"".

""AFL Victoria holds these clubs to ransom,"" he said.

Mr Brancatisano said joining the Ballarat competition would attract more players and spectators to Gisborne games.

He said the club would fight the decision by seeking legal action.

""They don't own us,"" he said.

""When you split up in a marriage, you don't hold someone as a hostage.

""That's what they are doing to us at the moment.""

Ballarat in favour

The board and members of the Ballarat league voted 46 to 4 to accept Gisborne into its competition.

But the Bendigo league lodged an appeal with AFL Victoria about the possible move.

In a statement, a Bendigo league spokesperson said AFL Victoria's decision on Tuesday was a ""a positive outcome"".

""The Bendigo Football Netball League looks forward to the continued participation of the Gisborne Football Netball Club as a highly valued member of our league,"" the spokesperson said.

Country football is often the lifeblood of regional communities. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)

In its decision, AFL Victoria found the transfer would be too ""strategically harmful"".

""The Bendigo Football Netball League is currently experiencing challenges and opportunities which must be managed as a strategic priority and prior to club transfers,"" the statement read.

The league, formed in 1925, currently has eight clubs in its competition, after losing two clubs in recent years, Maryborough and Kyneton.

In August, 193 out of a possible 223 Gisborne club members voted to move to Ballarat.

But the AFL Victoria statement said this was ""inconsistent"" with regulations as it did not occur before June 30.

Mr Brancatisano said there were sides all over country Victoria that were struggling, and grassroots competitions were ""in trouble"".

""It needs a whole overhaul,"" he said.

""It's on oxygen, mate.

""The AFL made a statement the other week [that] football is in such a good way and all the rest of it — that's bullshit, mate.""

He said there were 40 and 50-year-olds playing in the reserves side because players did not want to travel the long distances.

AFL standing in the way

Author Paul Daffey has written several books about country football in the past 25 years.

He said he understood why the club wanted to switch leagues and did not understand why AFL Victoria blocked the move.

""I think standing in the way is a waste of time, of everyone's time,"" he said.

"" Once the wheels are in motion, they just keep going, really. ""

The population of Gisborne is forecast to double by 2050 and Mr Daffey said population shifts drove most changes to regional competition.

"Melbourne Storm's Jahrome Hughes and Ryan Papenhuyzen return for NRL preliminary final against Cronulla Melbourne Storm are rolling the dice with Jahrome Hughes, naming the injured superstar halfback among three key inclusions as they gear up to host Cronulla in Friday night's NRL grand final qualifier.

Hughes has played only one match in the past two months, having broke his arm in a round 27 return from a shoulder dislocation.

But the Dally M Medallist has persuaded coach Craig Bellamy and the Storm's medical team he is fit for the blockbuster match at AAMI Park as Melbourne chase a berth in consecutive grand finals.

With his arm in a padded brace following surgery, the New Zealand Test number seven gave his injured arm a searching work-out on Tuesday before getting the green light to be included in the line-up.

Despite the huge news for Storm fans, skipper Harry Grant said Hughes still had a few hurdles ahead.

""He's been training pretty well and getting through what he has to do, but he's still got a fair bit to get through obviously with the week and how it builds and all that kind of stuff,"" Grant said.

Star trio out for Melbourne's first NRL final Photo shows A man runs the ball during a rugby league match The Storm continue to count the cost of its loss to Brisbane with Ryan Papenhuyzen and Nelson-Asofa-Solomona set to miss next week's final against Canterbury, and Jahrome Hughes confirmed to have suffered a fractured forearm.

Jonah Pezet, who starred at halfback in Melbourne's qualifying final win over Canterbury, is ready and waiting should Bellamy make a late switch, with Hughes himself saying he wouldn't jeopardise his team if he wasn't 100 per cent.

""I'm confident … it's the medical team that's going to have to see where I'm at, but in saying that I'm not someone that's going to put the team under pressure by coming back early so I'm going to be making sure I'm right to go,"" Hughes said.

""If I'm fully fit, I'll definitely put my hand up but I don't want to be going in at 50 per cent — it's not worth it, especially with having someone like Jonah there, being able to fill the void.""

As well as Hughes, fullback Ryan Papenhuyzen has been included after recovering from a head knock that ruled him out of the Bulldogs match.

Second-rower Shawn Blore, who has been sidelined for the past month with a fractured larynx, has been named on the interchange bench with initial fears his season was over.

Melbourne are wary of a Sharks' outfit which has won nine of its past 10 matches, thumping Canberra in the semi-finals to send the minor premiers packing from the premiership race.

Grant said Cronulla may have been ""flying under the radar"" heading into the finals but had made a statement with their recent form.

""They're such a star-studded team — big powerful outside backs, powerful forwards and just their spine just combining and really creating off the back of that,"" he said.

""They probably flew under the radar … and sometimes that's a good thing as you just knuckle down and get about your business and I think they've really done that this season, so we're expecting a firing Sharks team.""

Reynolds back to prove critics wrong, Mam's new Broncos role

Brisbane playmakers Adam Reynolds and Ezra Mam return from injury for the grand final qualifier against Penrith, with Mam set for an X-factor bench role.

Both return from five-week lay-offs to a side unbeaten since the pair suffered hamstring injuries in round 23 against Melbourne.

Reynolds said he was now ""100 per cent"" fit and ready to perform at number seven after a minor training setback three weeks ago.

In his absence, fullback Reece Walsh has been in electric form after forging a slick combination with Ben Hunt at half.

Hunt will shift to five-eighth against the Panthers at Lang Park but Reynolds refuted suggestions dynamo fullback Walsh would be impeded from showcasing his best.

""The media can make what they want of the last couple of months, but prior to that I was trying to get Walshy more ball, and they sit there and knock that down like it's a bad thing,"" Reynolds said.

""Not much will change. Walshy has been playing fantastic football and is a big part of the reason we are in this situation. I will be trying to get him as much ball as possible and if he sees an opportunity, it's open for him to take it.""

ABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.

Mam has moved well at training the past week and done enough to convince coach Michael Maguire he is ready to shine.

Instead of starting, the plan is for Mam to be injected into the match when fatigue sets in among his teammates, and utilise his renowned footwork to trouble the middle forwards and Penrith's edge defence.

The Panthers will remember how dynamic Mam can be after his hat-trick of tries in the 2023 grand final, won 26-24 by Penrith after a late Broncos' collapse.

""I am just really excited for him and to rub shoulders with him again on the field,"" Walsh said.

""I feel like we have a really good connection and a really good instinct about each other. I'm just ready to go after it with him.""

"Wallabies fullback Andrew Kellaway ruled out of first Bledisloe Cup Test match against All Blacks Wallabies fullback Andrew Kellaway will miss Saturday's Bledisloe Cup Test match against the All Blacks in Auckland, ruled out with a calf strain.

Kellaway is the second Wallaby ruled out with a calf strain for the Test, round five of the Rugby Championship, after forward Rob Valetini was ruled out last weekend.

He is also the second starting fullback to be ruled out during the Rugby Championship after Tom Wright suffered an ACL injury during the Wallabies' second match against South Africa.

Kellaway started the two Tests at fullback since Wright's injury, a win and a loss against Argentina, after starting the international campaign coming off the bench.

The Wallabies team will be named on Thursday, and despite losing his first and second-choice fullbacks, coach Joe Schmidt still has options.

Western Force outside back Harry Potter has played five Tests since debuting for the Wallabies last November against Scotland.

Potter started three Tests for the Wallabies in 2025, but injured his hamstring during the second Test against the Lions at the MCG.

Schmidt could also elect to go with 21-year-old rising star Max Jorgensen.

Jorgensen announced himself on the world stage with an 83rd-minute match-winner against England at Twickenham, and two tries during the Lions series.

Speaking to media on Tuesday ahead of what potentially could be his first Bledisloe Cup match, Jorgensen said playing against the All Blacks would be a major milestone in his career.

""It's such a big game. Every game counts, and if given the opportunity this week at the play-in, it would be a dream come true,"" Jorgensen said.

""Yeah, it's definitely a challenge, but it's an exciting one.

""I think for our group, coming back off a couple of games as a team to get the opportunity to play at Eden Park against a team like the All Blacks, it's always cool.

""They're a world-class team, they've always been good and always will be.""

Australia has not held the Bledisloe Cup since losing the trophy to the All Blacks in 2003.

The Wallabies have not won at Eden Park since 1986, while the All Blacks have not been defeated at the venue since 1994.

But the Wallabies come into Saturday afternoon's Test with plenty of confidence.

Since defeating the British and Irish Lions in the third Test in Sydney, the Wallabies broke a 62-year hoodoo at Ellis Park in Johannesburg with a famous win over the Springboks and a come-from-behind win over Argentina in Townsville.

The Wallabies are coming off a loss in their second Test against Argentina, coming from 21 points behind in the second half to narrowly lose 28-26 in Sydney.

With history not on the Wallabies' side, Jorgensen said each member of the Wallabies team was well aware of the challenge that awaits them on Saturday.

""It's pretty known within the group, and it really gives us a good opportunity this weekend to go out and win it back,"" he said.

"Canada beats New Zealand 34-19 to reach Women's Rugby World Cup final Canada has ended New Zealand's decade of dominance at the Women's Rugby World Cup — conjuring a 34-19 victory over the Black Ferns to reach the final and inflict a first defeat in the tournament on the double-defending champions since 2014.

Justine Pelletier, Asia Hogan-Rochester, Florence Symonds, and Sophie de Goede crossed for Canada in a stunning first-half performance, and Alex Tessier added another try after the break to extend what was already a healthy lead.

Six-time champions New Zealand produced a spirited fightback in the second half but could not prevent the Canadians reaching their second World Cup final after losing to England 11 years ago.

It was New Zealand's first World Cup semifinal defeat since 1991, with Canada now eagerly awaiting the winners of Sunday morning's second semifinal between England and France for the decider at Twickenham in a week's time.

""I'm excited already,"" said Canada coach Kevin Rouet. ""I said to the girls to stop crying because we have a job to do in eight days. That's the mindset. We need to finish the job and be ready in eight days.""

Ranked second in the world and one place above New Zealand, Canada was hardly underdogs, but its opponent's record spoke for itself, and when it came to the hardened business of winning World Cup semifinals, the southern hemisphere team is in a different league.

This was its eighth semifinal, and it had won the previous six, while Canada, by contrast, had lost all but one of its previous five last-four encounters.

The Canucks are an amateur side that launched a successful one million Canadian dollars ($1.1 million) fundraising drive in March — titled Mission: Win Rugby World Cup — to crowdfund their tournament.

If the Canadians were intimidated by the Kiwis' World Cup pedigree, they certainly did not show it as they took the match by the scruff of the neck with a devastating first-half display.

They scored their first try in the eighth minute when Alysha Corrigan played it inside to Pelletier, who sold a dummy, jinked back, and touched down.

Three minutes later, there was clear daylight between the sides as a long pass out to the wing found Hogan-Rochester, who shrugged off the tackle of New Zealand fullback Renee Holmes and crossed in the corner.

Canada extended its lead again in the 24th minute, laying siege to the New Zealand line, before the ball was thrown wide for Symonds to cross.

That seemed to jolt the Black Ferns awake, and their first period of pressure ended with Tanya Kalounivale picking the ball up and bundling over from close range to reduce the deficit.

Yet seemingly stung by their opponents' riposte, the Canadians crossed again before the break as Pelletier fed De Goede inside, and she galloped over from 25 metres out and added the extras to send her side in 24-7 up at the break.

Three minutes after the restart, Canada put its foot back on the throttle with a fifth try, as Tessier cut back and slid over, after an attack down the left was held up.

The contest, however, was reignited when Liana Mikaele-Tu'u drove over the line after a spell of New Zealand pressure, and when Sorensen-McGee collected Ruahei Demant's chip kick to the corner and touched down to reduce the deficit to 31-19 with 15 minutes remaining, it was game on.

It was swiftly game over, however, as a De Goede penalty calmed Canadian jitters, putting them more than two converted tries clear, a lead they were never going to relinquish.

""They were exceptional and it will be a great final,"" said New Zealand captain Kennedy Tukuafu.

""I think how far the women's game has come, it's pretty special to be part of this legacy, to see how big this tournament's been, the biggest there's ever been, so we can be proud of contributing to that.""

""But for now the O'Connors have a flight to catch. All three of us.""

The 68-Test veteran was initially due to join the Tigers following the British and Irish Lions series, but the 35-year-old stayed on for four Tests against South Africa and Argentina because of injuries in the playmaking ranks.

In his return to the Test arena after a three-year absence, O'Connor proved a valuable addition.

O'Connor helped Australia to a famous win over the Springboks in Johannesburg, and came off the bench to help the Wallabies overhaul the Pumas in Townsville.

Australian coach Joe Schmidt has said no decision had been made on James O'Connor's participation.

The Australian squad will be named this week for the two-Test Bledisloe Cup series against New Zealand, which doubles as part of the Rugby Championship.

Australia lead the championship on 11 points, one ahead of South Africa and New Zealand, who suffered a record defeat to the Springboks in Wellington over the weekend.

The squad is set to fly out on Monday for the September 27 clash against the All Blacks at Eden Park, meaning O'Connor would only have a few days on the ground in England.

However, coach Joe Schmidt has been non-committal about the future of 35-year-old O'Connor, with an eye on the future and his flyhalf stocks almost back to full strength.

Tom Lynagh is expected to be available following a hamstring strain and Ben Donaldson is back training after a thigh injury, while another youngster Tane Edmed had his first start at 10 last weekend.

Schmidt praised O'Connor's performance after the 28-26 loss to Argentina in Sydney on Saturday, but said no decision had been made on his participation.

O'Connor's last Bledisloe Cup match was in 2020 when New Zealand won the four-game series with two wins, a loss and a draw.

"All Blacks forced to re-group after 43-10 loss to Springboks in Rugby Championship New Zealand captain Scott Barrett has called on the All Blacks players to use the ""discomfort"" of their record 43-10 defeat to South Africa as fuel to rebound ahead of their next Rugby Championship clash against Australia.

A week after beating the Springboks 24-17 at Auckland's Eden Park, the All Blacks crashed to their worst Test loss on Saturday night as the visitors piled on 36 unanswered points in Wellington.

Lock Barrett, part of a forward pack that was well beaten on the night, said the sting of the defeat would not fade quickly over the two weeks before meeting the Wallabies at Eden Park.

""There'll be some real discomfort this week,"" he told reporters.

""But I'm sure this team will use that to bounce forward. We've got the Bledisloe [Cup] ahead and a chance to respond.""

After the Auckland encounter on September 27, the two sides meet again in Perth on October 4.

The Wallabies, who were beaten 28-26 by Argentina in Sydney on Saturday, lead the Rugby Championship with 11 points, one ahead of second-placed South Africa and New Zealand.

Having beaten South Africa with a smart aerial game at Eden Park, All Blacks coach Scott Robertson said his team failed to deal with their high balls in Wellington during the six-tries-to-one rout.

""When they [Springboks] got rolling, they were relentless. We couldn't buy a moment, and they punished us,"" Robertson said.

""They've been criticised for it in the past, but they own that space now. They put pressure on us, and it worked.""

While declining to blame his players, Robertson said the entire squad needed to take responsibility for the setback before they could move forward.

""Firstly, [we need to] own it,"" he said.

""Get some responsibility and find out what we need to fix.

""We're not going to be chasing too many things. We've got to be clear about what matters most to us on and off the field.

"Ange Postecoglou 'excited' to defend his Europa League trophy with Nottingham Forest Four months after leading Tottenham Hotspur to Europa League triumph in Bilbao, Ange Postecoglou has returned to Spain and UEFA's second-tier club competition with a new challenge, and he cannot wait.

Postecoglou ended Spurs' 17-year wait for a major trophy with that win over Manchester United — and was rewarded with the sack.

He is now at Nottingham Forest, and trophy drought is twice as long at 35 years. But it is not that 1990 Football League Cup win that Forest fans are recalling as they prepare for the club's visit to Seville to play Real Betis.

Ange's Spurs sacking the sad reality for awful league campaign Photo shows Tottenham Hotspur head coach Ange Postecoglou looks on during the post-season friendly match Ange Postecoglou flew into the Spurs job on a wing and a prayer, and surpassed expectations immediately. But long-standing structural issues and Postecoglou's own pigheadedness ensured a reversion to Tottenham's 'Spursy' norm.

Forest is a two-time European champion, having won the European Cup (now Champions League) in 1979 and 1980 under the charismatic managerial genius Brian Clough, and the memories still burn brightly.

But this will be its first continental tie in 10,781 days, since a UEFA Cup quarterfinal against Bayern Munich in March 1996.

Asked if it feels like a big moment for the club, the Australian said: ""Oh, absolutely. Without a shadow of a doubt.

""Thirty years, a club that's absolutely climbed to the peak of European football in the past and you can just imagine how the supporters are feeling.

""There's probably a couple of generations in there who've heard the stories but not lived the experiences. Now they can live their own experiences.""

For Postecoglou himself, the campaign is a title defence and he added: ""I'm excited by it. When I made the decision to accept the position, it was one of the most enticing bits.""

Forest will be cheered on by 3,385 travelling fans at the cavernous La Cartuja in Seville, where Betis is playing while its Estadio Benito Villamarin is redeveloped.

'Mic drop': Ange told you he always wins a trophy in his second season Photo shows Ange Postecoglou holds his hand on his chest When Spurs hired Ange Postecoglou, he was seen as an alternative to the ""winners"" who had gone before him. Now he's backed up his pre-season statement of always winning a trophy in his second season to silence the doubters. Again.

Postecoglou is in the early stages of transforming Forest from the safety-first football practised by his predecessor Nuno Espirito Santo to the attacking style he is known for.

He is yet to win a match after two defeats and a draw, all away from home, since taking over earlier this month.

While the team transitions, he recognises he may have to compromise, in Europe at least.

""It's fair to say that the world is crying out for me to be pragmatic,"" he said. ""But I'm just not built that way.

""I've always said what I like to do and what I enjoy more than anything is winning, so whatever it takes we'll do.

Ange's rise from the failed dream of the NSL to European glory Photo shows Ange Postecoglou holds a trophy In 2008, Ange Postecoglou was a Fox Sports pundit who felt unemployable. Now he's the first Australian football manager to win a major European club trophy.

""In the final we [Tottenham] had to play a certain way because of the availability of the players we had.

""I think you do have to approach the Europa League a little bit differently.

""Tactically, there's some tweaks you need to make to allow the players to perform at their best. I still want to win every game.""

Real Betis midfielder Giovani Lo Celso, who played under Postecoglou at Spurs, praised the Australian.

""Obviously, he is a great coach,"" the Argentina international said. ""He is a coach that likes the best kind of football.""

Betis lost the third-tier Conference League final to Chelsea last season and with Forest is among the Europa League favourites.

Coached by former Real Madrid and Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini, Betis has made a mixed start to the Spanish league season with three draws away and two wins and a loss at home.

"Ousmane Dembélé wins men's Ballon d'Or as Aitana Bonmatí joins elite club featuring Lionel Messi Ousmane Dembélé has claimed the Ballon d'Or on a night of triumph for his Paris St Germain club, while serial trophy winner Aitana Bonmatí of Barcelona took home the women's award.

The 28-year-old France forward Dembélé, who needed time and the guidance of PSG coach Luis Enrique to fulfil his potential as he inspired the capital club to their first Champions League title last season, became the sixth French player to lift the award and the first since Karim Benzema in 2022.

He beat Spain and Barcelona forward Lamine Yamal, with his PSG teammate Vitinha taking third place. Liverpool's Mohamed Salah finished fourth and did not attend the ceremony.

""What I have just experienced is exceptional, I have no words for it, what happened with PSG. I feel a bit of stress, it's not easy to win this trophy, and to have it presented to me by Ronaldinho, a legend of football, is exceptional,"" Dembélé said on stage at a Paris ceremony where he was supported by several teammates, the others being in Marseille for the Ligue 1 clash against OM which they lost 1-0.

""I want to thank PSG, who came to get me in 2023. It's an incredible family. The president, Nasser (Al-Khelaifi) is like a father to me. I also want to thank all the staff and the coach, who have been exceptional with me — he too is like a father — and all my teammates.

""We have practically won everything together. You supported me in the good and the difficult times. This individual trophy is one the team has won collectively,"" he added, later bursting into tears when he thanked his mother, who joined him on stage.

He also mentioned his first club, Stade Rennais, and the national team, vowing to win another World Cup next year with coach Didier Deschamps after their 2018 victory.

Dembélé's prize was one of several for PSG, who won the treble of Champions League, Ligue 1 and the French Cup last season as well as the UEFA Super Cup this year.

The French champions were named team of the season, Luis Enrique was voted best coach and Gianluigi Donnarumma, who left for Manchester City in the close season, was recognised as top goalkeeper with the Yashin trophy.

""It's the result of hard work, by everyone at the club,"" PSG president Al-Khelaifi said. ""We've got young players, and stars who work for the team. It's a collective achievement.""

Spain's Bonmatí, the Champions League player of the season, won the women's Ballon d'Or for the third time in a row.

Bonmatí won ahead of her Spain teammate Mariona Caldentey.

She is only the third player in the award's history to win three in a row after Michel Platini (1983–85) and Lionel Messi (2009–12).

""Third time in a row here and I still can't believe it,"" Bonmatí said.

""I owe Barcelona everything, this is the club of my life.""

She won a domestic treble with Barcelona and also reached the Champions League final.

Barcelona has won the last five women's awards but it was expected an Englishwoman would win for the first time.

England won the Euros and Arsenal took the Women's Champions League. But with five England players among the women's top 10 nominees, the highest-placed was Alessia Russo at third.

Australia's Steph Catley was also shortlisted for the award, finishing 29th in the voting.

Catley was named the fourth-highest-rated defender in the women's game.

While she did not take home individual spoils, Catley made the stage at the Ballon d'Or ceremony after her Arsenal side was named the women's team of the year.

Barcelona forward Vicky Lopez won the women's Kopa trophy and Sarina Wiegman, who led England to European victory, took the Johan Cruyff award for best women's coach.

The men's and women's Gerd Müller trophies for the top scorers went to Barcelona's Ewa Pajor and Viktor Gyokeres, who joined Arsenal this summer from Sporting Portugal after a prolific season.

"Tough times in Wagga Wagga as young tennis stars chase grand slam dreams When Cara Korhonen walked onto Rod Laver Arena at the age of 10 to have a hit with one of her tennis heroes, it sparked a dream that has taken her all over the world.

""[She] was telling me how well I was playing and that's a memory that has really stuck with me.""

The Gold Coaster is number 1,463 on the Women's Tennis Association rankings and has been playing since she first picked up a racquet at age four.

Her dream of grand slam stardom has taken her to Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the US, Finland — and Wagga Wagga.

Playing for love, not money

Competitors in the Women's 35 ITF World Tennis Tournament at Wagga Wagga are slugging it out for a share of $30,000 in prize money.

By comparison, the Australian Open offers a prize pool of more than $33 million across the men's and women's singles divisions and another $5 million for doubles.

But for players like Korhonen, the real prize on offer at Wagga is ranking points.

""Trying to get as many points as possible so it's much surer getting into these tournaments,"" she said.

""A lot of what I'm doing has to be on my own.""

That means she has to be as quick to spot a bargain as she is across the court.

""[I] go to Coles or Woollies and look at those quick sale items and just try and pick up any of those as much as possible,"" she said.

Mum along for the ride

Korhonen's mother Annelie has taken on the role of coach and support crew.

""Every single tournament you're more likely to be a couple thousand [dollars] out of pocket,"" she said.

""A first round on the main draw, that pays you about two nights' accommodation.

"" It's always you go home more or less on a minus, you've paid more than what you got back. ""

Gabriella Da Silva-Fick has been playing tennis for 15 years and is number 515 in the WTA singles rankings.

""People see those bigger tournaments and think it's all glamorous, but there's a lot of work that goes into it,"" she said.

""We book pretty much all our own accommodation, travel, flights. It's pretty much all out of our bank accounts, so there is a lot of pressure on results.""

The Collaroy local has competed in Europe and played in the Australian Open in 2019.

""What people don't realise is if we're sick or we're injured, we're not getting paid, so it's up to us to take care of our bodies,"" Da Silva-Fick said.

"Belgians break Australian hearts in Davis Cup classic Australia's tennis warriors have suffered Davis Cup despair, falling a set short of completing one of the greatest comebacks in the history of the 125-year-old competition.

A day after overcoming severe cramping to defy Alex de Minaur, unfancied world No.91 Raphael Collignon wore down late stand-in Aleksandar Vukic 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 6-3 in the deciding rubber to lead Belgium to a pulsating 3-2 second-round qualifying triumph in Sydney.

All up, the tennis ironman spent almost five and a half hours on court to break Australian hearts once more, after Australian captain Lleyton Hewitt — once engaged to Belgium's former world No.1 Kim Clijsters — also featured in crushing 3-2 losses to the small European nation in 2007, 2010 and 2017.

With two bold selection calls from Hewitt, his all-Sydney outfit had looked set to become only the third Australian team in Davis Cup history to overturn a 2-0 deficit.

An inspired three-set doubles win from Jordan Thompson and Cup debutant Rinky Hijikata and redemption for de Minaur in Sunday's first reverse singles rubber had levelled the tie.

De Minaur atoned for a shock first-day flop with a rousing 6-2 7-5 victory over Zizou Bergs to level the tie at 2-2, after Thompson and Hijikata recovered from the brink to pull off a tense 7-6 (9-7) 6-3 6-4 victory over Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen to keep Australia's hopes alive.

Thrust into the deciding rubber after Hewitt opted to rest Thompson following his epic two-hour, 24-minute doubles showing, Vukic took the opening set from Collignon.

But in the form of his career, having arrived in Sydney after taking down two-time grand slam finalist and world No.12 Casper Ruud at this month's US Open, Collignon could not be denied.

While Belgium will progress to the Final 8 in Italy in November, Australia will be missing from the quarter-finals for the first time since 2021.

Hewitt's class of 2025 had been striving to join Harry Hopman's legendary 1939 outfit featuring John Bromwich, Adrian Quist and Jack Crawford that beat the USA in the final as one of only three Australian teams to overhaul a 2-0 deficit.

Hewitt starred in the only other team to achieve the feat, winning the deciding rubber against Kazakhstan in Darwin to pilot his Australian teammates Nick Kyrgios, Thanasi Kokkinakis and Sam Groth into the 2015 semi-finals.

Alas, Australia will need to win two more qualifying ties next year to return to the quarter-finals.

In Sunday's doubles, after blowing four set points from 6-2 up in the tiebreaker, Australia's dynamic duo was in dire trouble in the second set, when Hijikata fell 0-40 down serving at 3-3.

But they staved off four break points to stay in the match — and the tie.

Riding the momentum shift, the Aussies broke the Belgians for a first time in the very next game to storm to a 5-3 lead and never looked back.

"Australia to face Belgium in Davis Cup in Sydney with Final 8 spot up for grabs Stung twice before, Lleyton Hewitt is refusing to underestimate Belgium as his much-fancied Australian team strives to return to the Davis Cup quarterfinals for a fourth straight year.

Runners-up in 2022 and 2023 and semifinalists last year, Australia hosts the Belgians at Sydney Olympic Park this weekend as hot favourites to again reach the Final 8 to be staged in Italy in November.

World number eight Alex de Minaur will play the 91st-ranked Raphael Collignon in Saturday's opening singles rubber before Australian number two Jordan Thompson faces Belgian number one Zizou Bergs in the second match.

At number 46 in the world, Bergs is ranked 33 spots above Thompson, leaving the first-day singles in the balance.

Hewitt knows the significance of getting off to a strong start ahead of Sunday's doubles and reverse singles rubbers.

While the visiting Europeans shape as big underdogs, Belgium has a history of breaking Australian hearts.

Belgium upset Australia 3–2 in the 2010 World Group play-offs in Cairns before denying Hewitt's team a place in the 2017 Davis Cup final with another improbable 3–2 triumph in Brussels.

Current captain Steve Darcis was the spoiler in both those ties, defeating Carsten Ball and Thompson respectively in the deciding fifth rubbers, and is plotting another boilover — and Hewitt is suitably wary.

""They're a great tennis nation. For a small country, they've had fantastic results in this competition,"" Hewitt said at Friday's draw.

""Their players always want to play and represent their country with a lot of pride and passion out there, so we're trying to prepare as well and as hard as we possibly can, and we're not taking anything for granted.

""Alex is kicking us off tomorrow, he's done all the hard work, he knows what he's got to do and now it's time to step up to the plate and execute and hopefully he can get off to a good start.

""And somehow we've got to win three out of the five matches.""

But with a big US Open win over two-time grand slam finalist Casper Ruud two weeks ago, Collignon knows ""anything is possible"" against de Minaur.

""I know my chances on paper is not very high but, yeah, we saw that in the US Open also against Casper,"" he said.

""He was number 12. I was 105 and I managed to win this match, so you never know what's going to happen.

""So I'm going to be ready to try to fight for the ball and let's see what happens.""

"Grand slam champion Lleyton Hewitt suspended for pushing anti-doping official Lleyton Hewitt has been allowed to captain Australia in this weekend's Davis Cup match in Sydney despite being hit with a fine and a ban for ""offensive conduct"" at a previous tie when he pushed a volunteer doping control official against a wall.

The 44-year-old grand slam great was on Wednesday handed a two-week suspension and $30,000 fine after being found guilty by an independent tribunal of pushing the 60-year-old anti-doping chaperone in an incident following Australia's semifinal defeat by Italy in Malaga last year.

The tribunal recommended one-third of the fine ($10,000) received by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) should be paid on to the chaperone ""in compensation for the stress, discomfort and embarrassment of the incident"".

The official has since said he will never volunteer at a tie again, with the ITIA saying that would ""represent a tangible loss to the anti-doping programme"".

The ITIA had pushed for a heavier sanction, asking for a four-week suspension and a $US25,000 ($37,500) fine, with the tribunal agreeing ""there was no apology or check on the well-being of the chaperone"" and ""a lack of remorse from Mr Hewitt"".

The agency also asked for Hewitt's ""poor disciplinary record, including five prior incidents of offensive conduct toward tennis officials and non-compliance with tennis rules"" to be taken into account, as well as his conduct during the hearing, which it said had been ""obstructive and inappropriate"".

Hewitt denied the charge and cited self-defence, but the tribunal upheld it, saying his behaviour was ""not reasonable and proportionate"".

But the tribunal rejected the ITIA's primary case that ""the push was unprovoked and born out of anger or irritation from the loss against Italy"".

But with Hewitt's side hosting Belgium this Saturday and Sunday in the second round of qualifiers, the tribunal's chair, Michael Heron, said they did not want to be ""unduly punitive"" on Hewitt by impacting his Davis Cup schedule.

The tribunal also wanted to give Hewitt time to appeal against the verdict if he wanted. The ITIA reported that so far, he and his team had not done so.

His suspension will start in two weeks' time, lasting from September 24 until October 7. Hewitt won't be allowed to take part ""in all tennis-related activities, including coaching, mentoring, playing, captaincy and other associated roles"" during that fortnight.

""Anti-doping personnel play a fundamental role behind the scenes in upholding the integrity of tennis, and they should be able to go about their roles without fear of physical contact,"" ITIA CEO Karen Moorhouse said in a statement.

""In this case, that line was clearly crossed, and we had no other option but to take action.""

ABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.

The incident happened when both Hewitt and the anti-doping chaperone were in the same crowded corridor and had made contact.

The tribunal accepted Hewitt had been recovering from a medical condition, which he said had prompted him to push away the official, who he didn't know was a chaperone, when there was contact between them.

But the tribunal found that the push was ""too strong or forceful and was excessive or disproportionate"" and that ""there were other options available"".

In Hewitt's defence, it was noted ""his distinguished 25-year career is marked by exemplary professionalism and commitment to tennis, and he's expressed genuine regret for the incident and bears no animosity towards the chaperone"".

"Macquarie to repay Shield investors after super platform failures Macquarie Investment Management has committed to repaying thousands of Australians who invested hundreds of millions of their retirement savings in the collapsed Shield Master Fund (Shield) amid admissions it contravened the Corporations Act.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has commenced proceedings in the Federal Court against Macquarie Investment Management after the subsidiary of Macquarie Group admitted that it did not act efficiently, honestly and fairly by failing to place Shield on a watch list for heightened monitoring.

The corporate regulator also accepted a court-enforceable undertaking from Macquarie Investment Management to ensure it pays members 100 per cent of the amounts they originally invested in Shield, less any amounts withdrawn.

Deep flaws in Australia's $4.3 trillion system exposed Photo shows A woman wipes away tears as she tells her story. The collapses of the First Guardian and Shield schemes have exposed deep flaws in the regulation of Australia's $4.3 trillion superannuation sector.

ASIC said, as a superannuation trustee, Macquarie Investment Management Ltd oversaw approximately $321 million in super investments into Shield by about 3,000 of its members between 2022 and 2023.

Those customers will now be fully compensated for any losses on their ""net capital invested"" by Macquarie, while the investment bank will be forced to wait until the liquidation of the Shield fund to recover some of those funds.

The ABC understands that Macquarie currently expects to recover around 70 cents in the dollar from the Shield liquidation, which means it would ultimately get back about $220 million of the $321 million funds it is paying out.

Investors will not receive any compensation for lost potential investment earnings during the period their savings have been frozen in the Shield fund since February 2024.

""This is an important outcome that stems from the significant losses that threatened thousands of members' retirement savings after they used Macquarie's platform to invest their super in Shield,"" said ASIC deputy chair Sarah Court.

""Many members thought their funds were safe when they used Macquarie's super platform to invest in Shield, which had no track record.

"" ASIC's investigation will see Macquarie return these members to the position they were in before their retirement savings were eroded. ""

Macquarie says funds will be paid out this month

The investment banking giant said in a statement that affected investors will receive the funds before the end of this month.

""Macquarie's decision to devote resources to achieve this outcome recognises Shield's unique circumstances, notably the scale of the issue, its material impact on many investors and their limited access to recourse from the many different entities which played a role,"" the company noted.

""The approach of providing immediate certainty and an improved outcome for investors benefits all parties.

""To enact the payments, Macquarie will purchase the investors' holdings in Shield at the current fair value, which is based on the estimated ultimate recovery from the liquidation process. In addition, Macquarie will make a goodwill payment to investors, with the two payments equating to 100 per cent of the net capital each client originally invested in Shield.""

Shield director Paul Chiodo told ABC News he welcomed Macquarie's involvement in the liquidation of the fund.

""We trust that Macquarie, in agreeing to pay members 100 per cent of the amounts invested less any amounts withdrawn, is scrutinising the liquidator to ensure noteholders' assets are not subject to fire sale, or that the noteholders will not continue to pay for the liquidation costs,"" he commented in an emailed statement.

"" There are still more than $200 million in investor assets sitting in Shield Master Fund, and Macquarie has the capacity to manage the portfolio in the best interests of noteholders. ""

As part of the deal, ASIC is not seeking penalties against Macquarie Investment Management, despite admissions it breached the Corporations Act.

The regulator said this is in recognition of Macquarie's cooperation, its willingness to fully compensate its affected members and to speed up the compensation of those whose retirement savings have been frozen as a result of the Shield collapse.

When quizzed on the lack of a penalty at a media briefing, Sarah Court said Macquarie was incurring a substantial financial cost, whether or not that was labelled a penalty.

""Our primary concern is to get money back to investors,"" she explained.

"" These are investors close to retirement age, they need certainty and they need certain peace of mind. ""

Ms Court said she hoped this settlement, if approved by the Federal Court, would send a message to other superannuation trustees about their responsibilities.

""If the court makes the declaration that ASIC is submitting that it should, it should really be sending a clear message to trustees,"" she told reporters.

""[If] they choose to operate those choice platforms and allow retail investors to put significant superannuation savings into them, there is an obligation on trustees to make sure that the funds that are available on their platforms are appropriate.""

Macquarie Group shares were down 1 per cent to $216.22 at about 11:50am AEST.

Deal only helps those who invested through Macquarie

While the 3,000 investors in Shield who accessed the fund through Macquarie's superannuation platform are now poised to get their money back, there are roughly 2,800 other investors who are not covered by this deal.

Most of them invested in Shield through Equity Trustees, which is also being sued in the Federal Court by ASIC for its role as a super platform host for the collapsed fund.

It is estimated that about $160 million was invested in Shield through the Equity Trustees super platform.

ASIC's Sarah Court told reporters she hoped other trustees might follow Macquarie's lead.

""I'd just encourage any of the other trustees to speak to us about how they can restore investors to where they were before they put investments in either the Shield Master Fund or the First Guardian Master Fund,"" she said.

It is a call echoed by Xavier O'Halloran from Super Consumers Australia.

""We're really calling on those other superannuation funds — Equity trustees, Diversa and Netwealth — to do the same thing, do the right thing morally by their members, if not legally, and compensate people,"" he told ABC News.

""Because people are facing massive uncertainty about their retirements right now and, without compensation, some people will be subject to poverty.""

And also by Garry Crole, the managing director of InterPrac, a financial planning firm that was a licensee overseeing many of the advisers who referred clients to investments in Shield and First Guardian:

""The outcome underscores the strength and integrity of the Australian superannuation system, which continues to be regarded as the best in the world,"" Mr Crole said.

""We hope this market-leading decision by Macquarie to place members first is followed by the other trustees and funds that oversaw Shield and First Guardian approvals on the APRA-regulated superannuation funds they oversee.""

Equity Trustees shares were trading down 7 per cent at $24.11 at about 11:45am AEST.

The company's market capitalisation on the ASX is just under $700 million and its most recent annual net income after tax was around $34 million, meaning that compensation on this scale would be a far more significant hit than it was for the much larger Macquarie Group.

First Guardian investors still chasing funds

Then there are roughly 6,000 people who invested funds in First Guardian, a separate fund that collapsed around the same time as Shield. They are believed to be around half a billion dollars out of pocket.

Ms Court said ASIC's investigations into the collapses of both Shield and First Guardian were continuing and more action was likely.

""We're investigating all of the trustees that are involved across these two funds,"" she told reporters.

""I'm not saying anything is imminent, but certainly we are investigating.

""I mean, each of these cases with the trustees, we have to look at the particular facts — each trustee has its own investment, governance framework and principles, and so we need to look at what was the framework, what was done, what was missed, what should the trustee have done?""

In another piece of good news for some First Guardian investors, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) has temporarily reinstated the membership of collapsed advice firm United Global Capital.

This move will allow hundreds of investors who put their money into First Guardian, acting on its advice to make AFCA claims against it, and potentially access the Compensation Scheme of Last Resort.

""This is a targeted, time-bound decision made in the public interest, responding to exceptional and unprecedented consumer harm,"" noted AFCA's CEO David Locke.

""It allows eligible complaints to be lodged and ensures consumers are not unfairly excluded from AFCA's process.

""The new deadline of 31 March 2026 provides fairness to consumers while giving certainty to industry.""

"Australia in a 'dangerous place' as AI adoption ramps up, prompting calls to protect jobs Artificial intelligence is already reshaping our workforce, but experts are split on whether AI will take your job or allow you to work smarter and faster.

It is difficult to estimate how many jobs in Australia have already been lost due to advances in artificial intelligence.

There have been widespread high-profile redundancies in industries heavily exposed to AI.

However, scores of recent redundancies announced at major employers like Telstra, NAB, Bendigo Bank, ANZ, the Bank of Queensland and Westpac have not been directly linked to the technology.

AI's momentum in Australia Photo shows An AI logo is shown in a conference It's estimated 30,000 people are working in the AI industry in Australia, yet there are concerns about hype and a lack of regulation.

That was also the case for other recent high-profile lay-offs at tech companies Microsoft, Atlassian and Canva.

Of the spate of recently announced job cuts, only the Commonwealth Bank has admitted to axing 45 roles due to AI — a decision it later reversed.

Still, AI-related job losses are happening, even if companies are reluctant to admit it.

For those affected by AI job cuts, the pain is real.

Kathryn Sullivan and Dhanushi Jayatileka are Finance Sector Union members and ex-CBA workers who have recently made headlines after speaking at a summit on AI organised by the ACTU at federal parliament in Canberra.

After 25 years of dedicated service at CBA, Ms Sullivan never thought she would lose her job due to AI.

Kathryn Sullivan says she was shocked when told her role would be made redundant. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)

""I was just in complete shock,"" Ms Sullivan said.

For the past four years, she had been working with the bank's messaging team alongside the AI chatbot.

""I was excited for the new technology and the new ways to assist customers, so I didn't even think any further ahead,"" she said.

""I didn't realise that what I was doing was actually going to end up with me losing my job over it or because of it.""

Dhanushi Jayatileka says AI wasn't blamed for job losses in her area. (ABC News: John Gunn)

Ms Jayatileka's product manager role was cut in a separate round of redundancies at the bank. CBA has denied that Ms Jayatileka's role was made redundant due to AI.

However, Ms Jayatileka said while AI was not explicitly blamed for four job losses in her area, the bank had been embedding the technology in workflows over several years.

""It's not a surprise; we have been waiting for the axe to fall,"" Ms Jayatileka told ABC News.

""You see roles are being hollowed out and recast.

""AI was brought in, and we taught the machines, and due to productivity gains, headcount was taken out.""

How many jobs are at risk?

Estimates vary on how many jobs AI could eventually replace.

Dario Amodei, CEO of US-based AI company Anthropic, has warned that up to half of all entry-level white-collar jobs could disappear within five years.

The International Monetary Fund has estimated that 300 million full-time jobs globally could be affected by AI-related automation.

Goldman Sachs has predicted that as many as half of all jobs could be fully automated by 2045, driven by generative AI and robotics.

AI 'gold rush' Photo shows A message reading ""AI artificial intelligence"", a keyboard, and robot hands are seen From robots to supercomputers, artificial intelligence is set to become an integral part of the Australian economy.

According to PwC's 2025 AI Jobs Barometer report, while AI is not collapsing overall employment here, it has been reshaping the workforce and making the entry-level job market especially fragile.

The report found that job growth since 2013 has been much stronger in low-AI-exposure sectors, with the gap widening since 2021.

In Australia, the most reliable forecast on the types of industries that will be affected comes from Jobs and Skills Australia.

Its recent report found 13 per cent of jobs could be automated by 2050 and more than half augmented by AI.

Industries most at risk of automation were clerical and administrative roles.

The types of jobs least at risk included logistics, manual labour and cleaning.

Optimists say AI will also create jobs

Professor Janine Dixon, director of the Centre of Policy Studies at Victoria University, whose research informed the Job Skills Australia report, said the picture was more nuanced than mass unemployment.

""We may see a bit of net job loss, but … the job losses that we're expecting from our study are not enormous,"" she said.

""AI will also improve productivity, which improves incomes and improves consumption, so there will be a lot of opportunities elsewhere in the economy.""

Professor Dixon said roles in health, education, care and construction were less prone to automation and could see strong growth.

""These are all roles that are not so much in danger of being automated away by AI. And so in future I think we'll see more people going into those types of roles.""

Janine Dixon says some roles such as health and education are less prone to automation and are likely to see strong growth. (ABC News: Scott Jewell)

But she also warned that workers may need to adjust their expectations. Or rather, settle for lower-paid jobs.

""The reality is that wage growth across some occupations will be weaker than they might have expected. But I think also that wage growth in other occupations may be stronger.""

For students, she said the priority should be building ""good AI literacy"" rather than worrying about losing jobs outright.

""Wage growth across some occupations will be weaker than they might have expected, but I think also that wage growth in other occupations may be stronger.

""There is some fear about people needing to switch from some occupation into another, and certainly that would be the case.

""For some people, but also I think people who are just entering the job market, young people, school leavers, will just enter on a different path.""

SA launches AI app in high schools Photo shows Two female students in grey uniforms look at a laptop on a table A ChatGPT-style app to be rolled out at all South Australian high schools next term has been welcomed by tech experts, who are also urging caution.

An example of this, Ms Dixon said, was that instead of becoming an accountant, students today may be better off looking at a career like physiotherapy or something in the health sector.

Physiotherapy students the ABC spoke to at Sydney University were using AI as a training tool.

Using an AI chatbot, they were able to have real-time conversations with simulated patient case studies.

""I wasn't too sure about how well the computer would be able to speak realistically about like a range of different things,"" said student Campbell Duff.

Physiotherapy lecturer Belinda Judd says she believes AI won't replace physiotherapists (ABC News: John Gunn)

Senior lecturer Belinda Judd, was confident AI would not replace physiotherapists, but instead would enhance the work they do, including in training.

"" I feel like our job is safe and certainly real people are still integral to what we do. ""

It was a sentiment shared by Dr Judd's students.

""I'm feeling pretty safe, which is good,"" Mr Duff said.

Tony Lo believes AI will be a useful tool in his future profession. (ABC News: John Gunn)

Student Tony Lo agreed.

""AI is more like a boost for the healthcare industry rather than trying to replace them.""

Not just job losses, but changes

Fiona MacDonald, director of the Centre for Future Work at the Australia Institute, agreed the bigger risk from AI was not mass unemployment, but the way jobs were changing.

Fiona MacDonald says AI will have a more significant impact on how we work, rather than on unemployment. (ABC News: Scott Jewell)

She said AI was already altering ""work processes"" and ""the ways in which people are managed and recruited to hiring and firing and performance management"".

""Some of the biggest impacts of AI are going to be on how we do our jobs and on our job quality and our autonomy at work … rather than being impacts on the labour market overall.""

CBA backtracks

CBA's decision to reverse 45 job cuts in its call centre is a high-profile example of how AI isn't always the answer for companies looking to increase productivity and presumably company profits.

CBA backtracks on AI job cuts Photo shows CBA logo CBA has apologised to 45 affected employees, after finding customer service roles were not redundant despite introducing an AI-powered ""voice-bot"".

But for Ms Sullivan, taking a redundancy was a better option than accepting another job at the bank that she said was not comparable to her previous role.

Instead, at 63 years old, she was now looking for work outside banking.

""To find myself in this situation and at my age, like, it's really frightening … I had a five-year plan and now it's like I don't even know if I'm going to be able to work full time.""

'A dangerous place to be'

Ms MacDonald said Australia was behind other countries when it came to regulating AI in workplaces.

""We are a bit of a laggard … I think where we are is a dangerous place to be because we need to make some decisions because what we do now will really matter in terms of how AI impacts,"" she said.

""We are at a crossroads, because AI is not an inherently good or bad thing.

""The ways in which we roll out AI and how we use AI, and who has control of matters a lot, and we won't get that chance again.""

The Australian Council of Trade Unions has called for strong guardrails on AI, including mandatory worker consultation, job security and retraining guarantees, strict limits on surveillance and data use, transparency and accountability for AI-driven decisions, and a national authority to regulate its rollout.

Ms Macdonald pointed to the European Union's AI Act, which treats the workplace as ""high risk"" and requires worker consultation, as ""best practice"".

Job sectors most and least at risk from AI Photo shows An image of a phone screen with an image of a photo it snapped accompanied by a chunk of text Artificial intelligence is predicted to influence many sectors of work, and it is no longer a question of if, but how. Yet experts say the technology can also bring opportunities.

""That means the guardrails require some involvement of people on the ground in the workplace through their trade union representatives or other worker representatives in having some sort of say in how AI is being used in those environments.""

For those who have already experienced the way AI is shaping our workforce, legal protections for workers should be an urgent priority.

""It is not just a problem for some of us, it is a problem for all of us,"" Ms Jayatileka said.","Australia in a 'dangerous place' as AI adoption ramps up, prompting calls to protect jobs",finance,N/A,Abc,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-25/australia-in-dangerous-place-as-ai-adoption-ramps-up/105807430,2025-09-25 00:00:00,"As AI adoption accelerates in Australia, experts express concerns about potential job losses and the need for regulatory measures to protect workers.

"Who is really pulling the strings at Optus and what does that mean for you? After a litany of scandals to hit Optus, questions have been asked about how a recent mistake could be made when a process had been put in place to rectify the same mistake in 2023.

Optus CEO Stephen Rue yesterday said he was determined to get to the facts and implement what needed to be done to ensure such things did not occur again.

It was hoped that an independent investigation, led by Kerry Schott AO, who was appointed by the Optus chair, John Arthur, would get to the bottom of it.

But we have been here before, which prompts the question: who is controlling Australia's Optus?

Who owns what?

The Singaporean government has significant influence over Australia's second-largest telecommunications company.

It starts with Temasek Holdings, which is fully owned by the Singapore government.

Singtel is currently majority (51 per cent) owned by Temasek Holdings.

And Singtel wholly owns Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider, Optus.

It's not surprising then that Singtel CEO Yuen Kuan Moon apologised to Optus customers on Wednesday, albeit more than six days after the incident occurred.

What is Temasek?

Temasek is essentially an investment vehicle or structure.

Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited is a Singaporean state-owned multinational investment firm, like Australia's Future Fund, in the sense that it is a sovereign wealth fund.

That is, it manages an investment fund on behalf of the government of Singapore.

Its legal status is as a fifth-schedule corporation in Singapore.

Fifth Schedule entities under the Singapore Constitution include GIC Private Limited, which manages the reserves of the Singapore government; the Central Provident Fund Board; the Monetary Authority of Singapore; the Housing and Development Board; and Jurong Town Corporation.

In other words, a Fifth Schedule entity has unique governmental protections.

Singtel apologises for Optus outage linked to multiple deaths Photo shows Singtel logo Optus's parent company says it will ""ensure a thorough investigation of this incident to prevent any future recurrence"".

These entities have unique safeguards, including requiring the Singaporean president's approval for key actions like appointing directors and auditing financial statements by the auditor-general.

It was incorporated under the Singapore Companies Act in 1974 to own and commercially manage investments and assets previously held by the Singapore government.

Temasek, it was decided, would own and manage these investments on a commercial basis.

Temasek's sole shareholder is the Singapore minister for finance, which, under the Singapore Minister for Finance (Incorporation) Act 1959, is a ""body corporate"".

This means it is a legal entity.

Who has been running Temasek?

Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara has been the CEO of Temasek since 2021. (Reuters: Edgar Su)

Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara was appointed as CEO on October 1, 2021, and remains the current CEO.

At the top of the corporate leadership ladder is Teo Chee Hean.

He is the former deputy prime minister and navy chief, and will become Temasek's fifth chairman on October 9, succeeding Lim Boon Heng, who has served since 2013.

What is its role in the Singapore economy?

""It has a dual purpose,"" Flinders University associate professor Michael Barr told The Business.

""Basically, one is to make money, and they like making a lot of money,"" he said.

Another is to ""protect Temasek's past reserves"".

The Temasek website also states: ""The Singapore government's role as shareholder in respect of board appointments is subject to the concurrence of the president in order to protect the integrity of the board of Temasek as a fifth schedule entity.""

Flow-on effect for Optus

Dr Barr said he was concerned Optus was not receiving enough attention from Singapore to keep its mobile network functioning properly.

""The government should be very concerned about that, simply because Singapore government-linked companies, as we call them, have a track record of under-investing.""

But Singtel CEO Yuen Kuan Moon said in a statement on Wednesday that Singtel, ""was committed to the continued transformation of Optus to improve the processes and resiliency of the company and improve the reliability of critical services.""

Kuan Moon Yuen has apologised for the triple-0 outage, saying Singtel ""will continue to invest"" in Optus. (Reuters: Albert Gea)

He added that, ""The Singtel Group has supported Optus by investing over $9.3 billion in the past five years, with a large proportion of that put to building network infrastructure across Australia, and will continue to invest as needed for Optus to provide reliable communication services to all Australians.""

Meanwhile, according to reporting by Nine, the Optus board will meet on Monday morning, September 29.

Optus chairman John Arthur will lead the discussion. Also present will be CEO Stephen Rue and Tan Ng Kuang Nicky.

But here is the critical question facing millions of mobile customers: can Australians trust Optus to provide reliable emergency services?

A journalist asked this question at Wednesday's press conference.

CEO Stephen Rue answered by saying: ""This is about making sure that we have recommendations that will be followed and to continue on with the other work that I have been doing.""

"Optus to pay $100m fine, as crisis engulfing Australia's second biggest telco continues Optus has been ordered to pay a $100 million fine over ""appalling"" sales conduct impacting hundreds of vulnerable customers for several years until 2023.

The company is being fined as it deals with its second triple-0 outage crisis in several years.

Optus had already agreed to pay the fine with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which brought the case against Australia's second biggest telco.

In enforcing the fine today, the Federal Court's Justice Patrick O'Sullivan described the company's conduct as ""extremely serious"" and ""appalling"".

""Many of the affected consumers were first nations Australians and were vulnerable,"" he noted.

He added that the customers were people with mental disabilities, people suffering from financial hardship, those with low financial literacy, and people with limited English proficiency and/or learning difficulties.

Many of them were from regional, remote, and very remote parts of Australia.

Optus faces $100m penalty for unconscionable conduct Photo shows optus 'yes' sign on glass fronted office block Optus admits to engaging in unconscionable conduct and agrees to a $100 million penalty for selling customers phones and contracts they did not want or need.

Justice O'Sullivan said ""inappropriate sales practices"" occurred across 16 stores in South Australia, Queensland, the Northern Territory, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania, between August 2019 and July 2023.

He noted that Optus's conduct comprised three categories of unconscionable conduct, including inappropriate debt collection practices, misleading or deceptive conduct, and systemic failure to explain the terms and conditions of contracts and to conduct coverage checks.

In some cases, people were sold plans even though they lived in areas where Optus reception was unavailable.

Optus previously admitted that its sales staff acted unconscionably when selling products and services to more than 400 consumers for that period.

""Optus senior management knew or ought to have known of the system failures that allowed the unconscionable conduct, which may rightly be described as predatory, to occur, yet failed to act with any sense of urgency,"" Justice O'Sullivan said.

""In failing to act notwithstanding knowledge, senior management abrogated their management responsibilities and consequently Optus abrogated any semblance of responsible corporate behaviour.""

'Totally and utterly unacceptable'

Optus boss Stephen Rue said on Wednesday in a press conference before the Federal Court's decision that the behaviour was ""totally and utterly unacceptable"".

""One of the very first things that I did was set up a whole-of-company review,"" he said.

"" We looked at our sales processes. We were looking at incentive schemes. We have brought back some of the franchise stores that were involved. ""

The telco said it had fully remediated most of the customers identified by the ACCC, and it would also pay $1 million to support digital literacy initiatives for First Nations Australians.

""We are working closely with financial counsellor services to help us identify and support customers impacted by sales misconduct,"" the company said in a statement after the court's decision.

""Optus is committed to working closely with the ACCC and an independent auditor to ensure the Enforceable Undertaking is implemented fully and transparently within the agreed timings.""

The five-year court-enforceable undertaking is set up to compensate impacted consumers and improve Optus's internal systems.

The competition watchdog welcomed the $100 million penalty.

""During the course of our investigation, we heard from many people who had not only experienced significant financial harm, but also emotional distress and fear after being pursued by debt collectors for long periods,"" ACCC deputy chair Catriona Lowe said in a statement.

"" A company of Optus's size should have had better systems and controls in place to identify and stop this sort of behaviour. ""

A former ACCC chair said the Optus licence should be looked at closely.

"China's President Xi Jinping announces new climate goal to cut emissions by 2035 China has committed for the first time to not only stop increasing carbon emissions, but to actually cutting them by 7 to 10 per cent by 2035, a move that reinvigorates the global emissions reductions push, even as the United States withdraws from the Paris climate change agreement.

Outlining China's new carbon targets in a video link to the UN climate conference in New York, President Xi Jinping said ""green and low carbon transition is the trend of our time"".

However, a day after US President Donald Trump called climate change ""the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world"", Mr Xi noted that ""some countries are against"" that trend.

China's targets make it the absolute global leader in climate change, a hugely significant development given it is currently the largest carbon polluter, and set the world's two superpowers on completely diverging paths on energy with Mr Trump pushing for a revival of fossil fuel based energy.

China turns into the world's first electrostate Photo shows A man stands on a busy market street with a looming coal plant's cooling towers in the background. China has put its economic might behind renewable technologies in a desire to stop relying on imported fossil fuels.

Mr Xi told the conference that China would increase solar, wind and hydropower to run more than 30 per cent of its power system over the next decade.

He also committed to making ""new energy vehicles the mainstream in the sales of new vehicles"".

His speech came shortly before Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese outlined Australia's new climate reduction targets for 2035 — announced in Australia last week — to the conference.

Australia has committed to cutting its emissions by between 62 and 70 per cent by 2035.

Mr Albanese says he welcomed the pledge by China to lower emissions.

""It is good that there is progress being made, we would like there to be more,"" he said.

"" We would like to see them do more and we would like to see no new coal-fired plants open. But it is a step forward. ""

When asked about Mr Trump's attack on climate action during his address to the UN on Wednesday, the prime minister refused to ""give a running commentary"" on the US leader.

Australia's national targets are higher than a number of comparable countries like Japan, Canada and New Zealand.

Members of the European Union failed to formally set a target for 2035 before the deadline last week, but EU President Ursula von der Leyen told the UN conference that the group's nationally determined contribution ""would range between 66 per cent and 72 per cent"".

China's carbon emissions may have peaked Photo shows A man in a red hard-hat stands in a field of massive solar panels speaking to someone out of frame Experts say Beijing's commitment to renewable energy is revolutionising the country's energy usage, and it could impact the fight against global warming and a key Australian industry.

""We will formally submit our NDC ahead of [the climate change conference in Brazil next month],"" Ms von der Leyen said.

""But in parallel, we are also looking ahead. We're working on a 2040 target of a proposed 90 per cent emission reduction. That is our way to climate neutrality by 2050.""

Mr Albanese told the conference that, 10 years after the Paris climate change agreement was struck, it is now ""the decisive decade for acting on the environmental challenge of climate change but also seizing the economic opportunities of clean energy"".

"Solar, batteries and the 'phone charger dilemma': How a standards gap threatens clean tech At first blush, Robyn O'Reilly is like many people in her position when it comes to her power use.

The retired insurance worker lives alone in the port-side Adelaide suburb of Ethelton, a place she has called home for decades.

As a pensioner, she keeps a close eye on how much electricity she uses and feels keenly any nasty surprises that might arrive with a bill.

""I'm lucky because I do get concessions as well,"" Ms O'Reilly says.

"" But if I didn't get them, it would be hard. It would be really hard. ""

In other ways, however, Ms O'Reilly defies stereotypes.

Her home is fully electrified.

From her cooktop to her water and space heaters, it is electricity, rather than gas, that provides the required power.

""So everything I run in the house is off electricity, yeah,"" she says.

Conducting the orchestra

Though unremarkable to observe, a home energy management system can conduct a home's power use. (ABC News: Daniel Mercer)

Coordinating it all is a little-known piece of tech called a home energy management system.

If the devices were the instruments and their players in an orchestra, the management system would be the proverbial conductor.

In Ms O'Reilly's case, it is programmed to maximise her use of power at times when that electricity is cheap — namely, these days, in the middle of the day when solar power is abundant.

For example, she says, the system typically runs the heat pump between 10am and 3pm to ensure she has hot water at little cost.

Conversely, it avoids using such devices at times when power prices are high, such as during the evening peak when the sun has gone down.

Not that Ms O'Reilly has no agency — through an app on her phone, she can take control of the devices and even command them remotely.

""I've found it really, really good, actually, easy to operate,"" she says.

Heat pumps can be timed to warm water and can do so much more efficiently than other technologies. (ABC News: Brant Cumming)

""I have a heat pump hot water system that I have put in and that seems to be really economical.

""And with the heating, look, if I'm cold, I run it.""

The results, so far, speak for themselves.

According to Ms O'Reilly, her last electricity bill was just $124 for the quarter.

By comparison, she says the final gas bill before electrifying her home was $200 over a three-month period.

""It did say I was using 23 per cent more electricity than this time last year, but my bill was cheaper,"" she notes.

Flexibility increasingly key

Ms O'Reilly was given the management system by South Australia Power Networks, the poles-and-wires company.

SAPN, as it is known, is running a trial that aims to test whether household appliances from solar panels and batteries to electric vehicle chargers and heat pumps can be orchestrated to the benefit of consumers — and the grid.

Sam Craft from SAPN says common standards could make clean tech easier for consumers. (ABC News: Daniel Mercer)

Sam Craft, SAPN's customer innovation manager, says the way we generate electricity is changing from a system based largely on coal — which likes to run around-the-clock at a steady rate — to one that depends on renewable energy.

Renewable energy, by contrast, is variable in its output — plentiful sometimes and scarce at others.

As a consequence, Ms Craft says the electricity system needs to become increasingly flexible to deal with this variability.

""We're trying to find a sweet spot between orchestration and reward for customers when it comes to flexibility in their appliances,"" Ms Craft explains.

""So, for example, if we can shift some appliances into the middle of the day and that costs less for customers, that would be a really great thing for the grid.

"" But it would also be a really great thing for customers and their pockets. ""

Ultimately, she says the vast number and array of clean tech products going into homes across the country could become a huge asset for the energy system — a source of both supply and demand on a massive scale.

Australia's demand for electricity is increasing. Managing it efficiently will be crucial. (ABC News: Brant Cumming)

For this reason, experts have long been calling for a set of common technical standards to be applied to technology from solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicle chargers to air conditioners and heat pumps.

Doing so, they say, will allow more and more of Australia's clean tech fleet to be ""harmonised"".

The 'phone charger dilemma'

Right now, however, Ms Craft says the state of the market is discordant because too many devices cannot be operated by other manufacturers' systems or software.

They are not, she says, interoperable.

""We're seeing a lot of barriers when it comes to something called interoperability or how different appliances talk to other appliances,"" she says.

""Interoperability is a language that different appliances talk to each other with, and everything's got its own language.

""So really simply, it's sort of like how Samsung had one type of charger and Apple had another and now they have the same.

Clean, smart tech can increasingly allow householders to see what's happening in real time. (ABC News: Brant Cumming)

""Interoperability is very much about simplifying and standardising the way that things happen and work so that customers have ease.

""It's really important because as we evolve through electrification, we need to make all of these energy appliances smarter and more simple and easy to use.

""And if they can talk to each other, it makes a lot of things a lot more easier.""

The concerns relate to the practice of building so-called walled gardens, where companies try to lock consumers into their products by making it difficult for them to switch to others.

Technology firms, led by Apple, have been the most famous and successful exponents of the practice.

Standards reform 'badly needed'

South Australia's energy minister, Tom Koutsantonis, acknowledges that the risk of walled gardens in clean tech poses a big problem.

Mr Koutsantonis says the difficulty in properly orchestrating household clean tech boils down to a fundamental tension.

He says what consumers want — and what, on balance, is likely to be in their best interests — is not necessarily the same as it is for the companies making the gear.

South Australian Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis. (ABC News: Lincoln Rothall)

To overcome these problems, the minister says governments, inevitably, are going to have to step into the breach.

""Well, if you're Volvo or you're Tesla or you're Ford, you don't want some off-the-shelf home management scheme to run your car battery,"" Mr Koutsantonis says.

""They want to run the home.

""Most home owners don't want Elon Musk or Ford or Volvo running their home electricity grid, right?

""So, we've got a problem here, a management issue, whether it's kettles, dishwashers, whatever it might be, the entire system needs planning reform.

""We need standard reform. We need a level of orchestration that we've never had before on a minute level.""

Ms Craft from SAPN says an absence of common standards means consumers are likely to end up spending more than they would otherwise need.

In the same vein, she says the entire electricity system will be less efficient than it could or should be.

In technology we trust?

For those able to afford and manage it, clean tech can dramatically lower bills. (ABC News: Daniel Mercer)

By streamlining standards, Ms Craft says the country could save a fortune in needless duplication and waste, citing a study by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which found the pay-off could be as high as $18 billion over the course of the energy transition.

""What we don't want to see is a situation where a customer has to upgrade their entire home to a certain brand or a certain product in order for them to have a simplified smart home,"" Ms Craft says.

""That's going to create another barrier that we're not ready for, that they're not ready for.

"" We want to make sure that there are standards in place so that the products that they use can all integrate together, rather than needing to have a certain brand or a certain type in order to evolve to this type of home. ""

At home in Adelaide, Robyn O'Reilly can vouch for the convenience of devices that can act — and be run — seamlessly with one another.

She says the ease with which her own system operates is a blessing, noting that she is not inclined to actively manage the system herself all day.

Robyn O'Reilly is happy for technology to manage her power use, so long as it benefits her. (ABC News: Brant Cumming)

And although she is yet to take the plunge and get solar panels and a battery, she says this could change.

To that end, Ms O'Reilly says she is happy to leave the decisions to the technology — so long as it benefits her.

"Will food prices ever come down? Don't bet on it While recent cuts to interest rates may have given mortgage holders a bit of a financial breathing space, the cost of food continues to creep upward.

The latest Australia Bureau of Statistics Consumer Price Index (ABS CPI) figures show that food and non-alcoholic beverages were up by 3 per cent in the 12 months to July 2025.

Fruit and vegetables were up 4.8 per cent for the same period.

Independent economist Saul Eslake has looked at the ABS CPI over a longer time frame, dating back to the 1980s.

""Prices in general, and food and non-alcoholic beverages in particular, hardly ever come down,"" he said.

Mr Eslake said that when looking at the annual rate of change in the CPI index of food and beverages, there have only been four times in the past 45 years when prices have fallen (2012, 2013, 2016, and in 2017).

""The falls on the last three of these occasions were all less than 1 per cent,"" he said.

The cost of fruit and vegetables is more volatile than other food items. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)

And each of these occasions was largely the result of big falls in fruit and/or vegetable prices, resulting from earlier cyclone- or flood-driven spikes being unwound, he said.

All major food groups have trended upwards over time, and rarely come down.

Fruit and vegetable prices are more volatile than other food items.

Egg prices have risen by 49 per cent over the past three years, mainly due to the impacts of bird flu.

""Egg prices are also historically a bit more volatile than most other food items, though not as much as fruit and veggies,"" Mr Eslake said.

"" It's possible that at some point at least part of this increase in egg prices could be reversed. ""

Government pressure has not resulted in reduced prices

Pressure from the government and a Senate committee on supermarket prices has not resulted in big changes to the cost of groceries.

Labor's supermarket price ban explained Photo shows A supermarket aisle with shelves of rice being advertised as half-price. The details of a price gouging ban would only be decided after an election, but there are precedents to draw on.

Aldi was the cheapest at $20.08, followed by Coles at $21.30, Woolworths at $21.40, and IGA at $23.89.

Mr Serrels said the rise in the cost of food was putting pressure on Australians, many of whom were not seeing significant increases in wages.

Thieves take advantage of 'no-challenge' approach

Professor Townsley said self-checkouts had made it easier to steal food, with some thieves using the ""trolley push out"" method.

He explained thieves appeared with a ""trolley laden with stuff"" and looked like they were ""about to purchase"", but simply ""push it out of the store"".

Professor Townsley said most retailers encourage staff to adopt a ""no-challenge"" approach to people they suspect of stealing.

""The reason for that is the consequences of a staff member getting involved in an altercation with a customer could be quite serious … if they get injured.""

He said it was one of the reasons why staff faced escalating incidents of verbal and physical abuse.

"Hundreds of new dust-related lung disease cases recorded in Queensland Nearly 300 workers who have developed deadly lung diseases after being exposed to dust at Queensland mines, construction projects and worksites have had their cases recorded on a government register in the past year.

Of the 292 workers with cases added to the state's Notifiable Dust Lung Disease Register, 121 were diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 96 had respiratory cancers and 93 had pneumoconiosis.

Most workers were aged 60 years or older, but there were four workers aged between 20 and 39.

Six of the workers had died by the time their case was recorded on the register.

Workers were most frequently exposed to asbestos, followed by mixed dust, coal and silica, according to the register.

All of the workers recorded were occupationally exposed in Queensland, with 94 per cent stating their primary exposure occurred in the state.

The new cases have reignited warnings from doctors, lawyers and advocates that more needs to be done to prevent occupational dust exposure.

Craig Keogh developed ""black lung"" after working in mines in Queensland and New South Wales. (ABC News: Jack Rowland)

Former coal miner Craig Keogh was diagnosed with pneumoconiosis — also known as ""black lung"" — in 2018, after being exposed at Queensland and New South Wales mines.

He said the number of new cases was disgraceful.

""That's 292 death sentences because there's no cure,"" Mr Keogh said.

""Once you've got it, you're on death's door.

""It doesn't just impact one person, it's their families, their friends — it impacts a lot of people.""

After his diagnosis in 2018, Mr Keogh took his fight against several employers to court.

He became the first person to win a black lung case at trial and was awarded $3.2 million in damages.

""It's destroyed me,"" he said.

""I was healthy, fit and working, and as soon as I got diagnosed, I couldn't walk onto a mine site.

""My career ended and the financial impact was huge, and the mental impact — it's taken a big toll on me.""

The former miner said while safety education efforts had improved in recent years, more needed to be done.

""Prevention is key — people need to be aware of where they're working and the dangers,"" Mr Keogh said.

More than just health damaged

Royal Australasian College of Physicians fellow and senior occupational physician Graeme Edwards said it was tragic that there was even a need for a government register of the cases.

""Each one of these workers are having to suffer and each one of these conditions are eminently preventable,"" he said.

""Four of those workers were under 40, another 48 were under 60, the majority were in their retiring years.

"" The insult to their life is severe — not just in terms of the physical constraint of the actual disease itself, but because they get restrictions on what they can do for gainful employment. ""

This year, the register also highlighted silicosis, a disease caused by inhaling respirable crystalline silica dust, after a national focus on the disease in recent years.

Forty-one workers had new confirmed cases of silicosis added to the register in the past financial year.

Calls to better protect workers

Shine Lawyers dust diseases practice manager Roger Singh said overall, it was appalling that the number of workers diagnosed with dust diseases was not declining.

""That is because of dereliction of duty,"" he said.

"" We probably have … over 100 cases involving an array of dust-related diseases because of the negligence on the part of employers and manufacturers. ""

"China retains narrow edge over US as South-East Asia's most influential partner New research shows that China retains a very narrow edge over the United States as South-East Asia's most influential partner, with experts predicting it will soon pull further ahead as the Trump administration's policies begin to bite in the region.

The Lowy Institute's 2025 South-East Asia Influence Index maps the relative strength of outside players in the rapidly growing and fiercely contested region, including the US, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Russia.

The paper finds that China has a clear lead as the most influential player in six out of the 11 countries in South-East Asia, including Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia

That makes it the most significant power overall in the region, although it is not a dominant force.

The US is trailing only just behind China in its influence, maintaining a clear lead over Beijing in both Singapore and the Philippines, and almost matching it in Vietnam and Thailand.

But the Lowy Institute's Susannah Patton said US influence in the region was already eroding, and that Donald Trump's moves to hit South-East Asia with hefty tariffs — while slashing foreign aid and tightening migration — would accelerate the region's drift towards China.

""The actions of the Trump administration are only likely to exacerbate that trend … all of this is likely to further undercut US standing in South-East Asia in the years ahead,"" she said.

"" Imposing significant tariffs is not positive for US influence in the region. ""

China's influence not 'hegemonic'

The index finds that China's greatest strengths are in trade and economic engagement with South-East Asia — it is the region's leading export market, responsible for around 26 per cent of the region's imports and an increasingly important source of private investment.

It is also the region's top diplomatic partner, maintaining an extensive network of embassies and keeping up a steady tempo of high-level political engagement across the region — in stark contrast to the US.

But Ms Patton said China lagged in other areas, trailing the United States in cultural influence and maintaining relatively weak defence networks across South-East Asia.

""We don't describe China as hegemonic in its influence … it's not the leading partner for South-East Asia across all dimensions of influence,"" she said.

""For example, when it comes to defence networks, China is making some efforts to establish more substantial defence partnerships, but it's still fairly limited and much less than that of the United States.""

"Optus triple-0 outage tragedy: What we know and how events unfolded The first public sign anything was wrong at Optus came when newsrooms around the country began fielding calls from its communications staff late on Friday afternoon.

The brief was to get down to the Sydney Optus HQ, or join the Teams livestream, as soon as possible — CEO Stephen Rue would be holding an important press conference, but no further details would be given.

What came next shocked the nation.

When Mr Rue started speaking at 5:45pm AEST — it was to report the tragic news that three people had died after a network outage stopped some customers from calling the emergency triple-0 line.

It was Optus's second major outage in less than two years and is now subject to a major investigation by the communications regulator.

While there are still a lot of questions, this is the timeline so far (times in AEST).

Thursday, September 18

Triple-0 calls first started failing to connect early on September 18.

2:17am — 2:30am

Optus customers in Western Australia are unable to reach triple-0.

At this time Optus is running a ""firewall update"", during which, according to Mr Rue, ""established processes"" are not followed.

9am

The first two of five calls are made to Optus's overseas call centres to say they cannot reach triple-0.

Those calls are not escalated.

Optus has not revealed exactly where those offshore call centres are located; however, it has 3,600 overseas contact centre staff and 250 staff in Australia.

1:30pm

A customer contacts Optus ""directly"" about the outage.

Mr Rue said this was when he became aware of the severity of the failure.

1:50pm

South Australian Police contacted Optus to advise that they have been alerted to connection issues.

SA Ambulance also reports a drop off in triple-0 calls.

The firewall update was stopped and restarted.

Optus said the service was back up and running.

3pm

Optus email Communications Minister Anika Wells to say there had been an outage that affected 10 calls.

Evening (exact time unknown)

Welfare checks begin.

Mr Rue has defended the time it took the company to begin the welfare checks, which did not begin earlier because of the ""complexity of pulling records from the network"".

11:20pm

Optus contacts WA Police to advise 26 calls to triple-0 failed to get through.

Optus advises WA Police it's a ""minor outage"" and the network has been restored.

WA Police immediately begin welfare checks on these households.

Friday, September 19

3:40pm

Optus informs Ms Wells that 100 triple-0 calls had failed.

4pm

Optus updates Ms Wells to say 600 triple-0 calls had failed.

Her department is informed of three deaths.

4:46pm

Optus announces that a press conference will be held at 5:30pm.

4:47pm

WA Police received an email from Optus informing them an additional 123 triple-0 calls failed.

WA Police are also informed one person had died.

5:45pm

The press conference begins where Mr Rue confirms three people had died, one in WA and two in SA.

The deaths include: An eight-week-old boy from the Adelaide suburb Gawler West A 68-year-old woman from the Adelaide suburb Queenstown A 74-year-old man from Willetton in Perth

It is the first time the public hears about the outage.

7pm

SA Premier Peter Malinauskas holds a press conference, saying Optus had not told the SA government about the deaths before Mr Rue's press conference.

""I have not witnessed such incompetence from an Australian corporation in respect to communications worse than this,"" Mr Malinauskas said at the time.

SA Premier Peter Malinauskas slammed Optus after the first press conference.

8:48pm

Singtel, the Singaporean company that Optus is wholly owned by, posts a statement on the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX) announcing the investigation into the triple-0 failure.

At this time, the SGX is closed.

Saturday, September 20

3:20pm

Mr Rue hosts another press conference where he confirms Optus call centres were informed about the outage at 9am on Thursday.

He apologises for late notifications to premiers and chief minister and says Optus will ""urgently"" look into its process for notifying regulatory and government agencies.

He says he will appoint an ""independent person"" to lead a review into the incident.

4:20pm

WA Police confirm a fourth person, a 49-year-old man from Kensington in Perth, has died after failing to connect to triple-0.

Sunday, September 21

11:30am

SA Police say the death of an eight-week-old baby boy was unlikely related to the outage, as his grandmother immediately used another network to call triple-0.

3pm

Mr Rue holds another press conference and places an immediate halt to further changes in the network.

He also confirms two callers in NSW near the SA border were also unable to contact triple-0.

5pm

A NSW government spokesperson confirms they were not informed of the callers' inability to contact triple-0 until Sunday, three days after it happened.

8:45am

Australian Communications Media Authority (ACMA) chair Nerida O'Loughlin confirms ACMA has launched an investigation into the outage.

Ms Wells tells reporters Optus will be ""held accountable"" for the outage.

5pm

Optus confirmed an additional seven calls failed to connect to emergency services, four of which were from WA.

6pm

WA Opposition Leader Basil Zempilas says he wants the lights on the Optus sign at the Perth Stadium to be turned off.

""Optus does not deserve to have their name on our stadium and it should revert to Perth Stadium,"" he told ABC Perth radio.

What's next?

An investigation and independent inquiry will be held into the incident.

"Could artificial intelligence and a universal basic income eliminate 'meaningless jobs'? Australia essentially did it during COVID. The world's richest man thinks it's inevitable. And a growing body of research suggests it could be the answer to AI shattering long-held high rates of employment.

A Universal Basic Income, or UBI, is a regular, obligation-free payment to everyone. There are different models, but those key elements endure in research studies and pilot projects around the world.

""Creating a base that everyone can access without any barriers is really important for a world where things are changing really rapidly,"" says Ben Spies-Butcher, ""and where the kinds of risks people are exposed to are changing as well"".

Ben Spies-Butcher thinks the changes AI will bring demand a response like UBI. (ABC News: John Gunn)

The associate professor of economy and society at Macquarie University says the JobKeeper and 'coronavirus supplement' received by millions during the pandemic shows we can create a payment that everyone is entitled to, which would let them live at least a ""decent, basic"" life.

"" It proved that we could do it. Because we actually did it. ""

We've already had a UBI

The COVID pandemic showed us how society can function even in times of high unemployment — if we support the community with regular payments so they can live.

When COVID forced people to stay home, between 3.6 million and 4 million Australians were supported by the JobKeeper payment.

In addition, a further 2.2 million people who received some form or welfare payment (such as JobSeeker, colloquially called 'the dole') enjoyed a top-up payment called the coronavirus supplement that massively boosted — in most cases essentially doubled — their income.

Australian cities became deserted during COVID lockdowns, with hundreds of thousands of businesses shut. (ABC News: Jim Malo)

At one point, more than 43 per cent of the adult population was receiving a regular, obligation-free payment from the government.

With artificial intelligence threatening to shatter entire sectors and occupations, is it time to talk about a universal basic income to secure our future?

Global research finds UBI has benefit

Research before and after the pandemic has given us a better idea of the positive impact of a basic income.

""COVID showed us how precarious the idea of employment is … how shaky those foundations are,"" UBI proponent Elise Klein says.

"" All of a sudden, so many of us were in a very economically insecure situation. ""

The associate professor of public policy at the Crawford School at the Australian National University says COVID provided a ""natural experiment"" of the impact of a basic income.

Elise Klein says people's roles are changing dramatically with the use of AI. (ABC News: Tobias Hunt)

""We found that poverty rates for folks that are receiving JobSeeker went from 67 per cent down to 7 per cent, associate professor Klein says.

The research Klein and her colleagues did found the income boost helped people prepare to enter the labour market.

""They were able to have their foot off their neck a bit and be able to engage in the labour market,"" she explains.

""To get out of debt, to meet basic needs and, of course, make themselves feel good — it had huge psychological impacts that helped people feel that they had dignity again.""

Has AI impacted your life plans? The ABC wants to hear from you Photo shows A graphic image showing people sitting for a job interview including a robot. Whether you’re a student halfway through a degree or a mid-career manager planning the next 5 years, artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping lives across the country. If you've been feeling its effects, the ABC want to hear from you.

The Stanford University Basic Income Lab has tallied about 160 global UBI experiments in the last four decades. They range in the objective they are focused on, the number of people in the study, and the value of the money they receive.

""The biggest one is actually Give Directly in Kenya, that's going on for 12 years and it's working with 20,000 Kenyans, over 200 villages,"" Klein says.

""Preliminary results from that study are really positive that it's showing huge improvement in people's lives.""

The program (now operating in other African countries) found it decreased infant mortality and family violence, while boosting consumption spending, savings and local economic activity.

But the research doesn't convince everyone.

'I don't think it's been a fantastic seven years for advocates of a UBI'

Eight years ago, the ABC investigated the possibility of a universal basic income as a response to a rise in automation and increasing computing power.

Money for nothing Photo shows People stand outside a Centrelink office With robots and artificial intelligence poised to take over many current human jobs, is a universal basic income the answer to keep the unemployed masses out of poverty?

At the time, the estimate to give everyone a payment at the level of the unemployment benefit (then called Newstart) was around $240 billion a year — at a time when the overall spend for the Australian government was about $450 billion.

In the live example of COVID, the cost of the JobKeeper wage subsidy was $88.9 billion.

The coronavirus supplement cost more than $20 billion over most of 2020 and part of 2021.

Even if more generous existing benefits, such as the aged and disability pensions, were reduced to the level of a UBI, the net cost would still be huge.

""You would still have to find something like $170-190 billion (annually) in order to fund this scheme,"" Simon Cowan, research director at think tank the Centre for Independent Studies, estimated at the time.

Far from shifting his view, the experience of the COVID pandemic has hardened it.

Simon Cowan says free money sounds great but finding that extra money will be the problem. (ABC News: John Gunn)

""It's probably confirmed some of my scepticism about UBI,"" he says now.

"" I think also we've probably seen an increasing amount of evidence about what people would do in terms of receipt of that payment and how it would influence their behaviour. ""

Normally, superannuation is quarantined until people reach a certain age, usually 65.

Cowan points to studies that show people who were allowed to withdraw super under emergency provisions in COVID spent it on gambling, alcohol and takeaway food.

""People who got access to cash where there was no obligation connected to it, when it wasn't earmarked for anything in particular, they spent it on leisure activities ... a lot of people just spent it on things that gave them short-term benefit,"" he says, while acknowledging that some people paid down debt and that COVID confinement reduced people's ability to spend money outside of their house.

""There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but from the perspective of a policy reform, particularly an enormously expensive one, it's hard to imagine that there's a strong societal benefit.""

But it's not all bad

On the flip side, Cowan says studies in the US show benefits to cash payments like a UBI.

""For example, there are some young mothers who, rather than going back into the workforce and putting their kids into childcare, they take access to that money and use that to stay home and spend more time with their kids,"" he observes.

""Students or potential students, some of those people will decide to stay at school or go to university rather than go out and work, so there is a benefit in terms of some of the reductions of those pressures.""

But, in his view, none of this outweighs the potential cost — immense billions of dollars would need to be raised from new forms of tax.

"" Whenever we talk about the benefits of UBI, we also have to talk about the downsides that would come with raising the money to pay for it. ""

Cowan also disputes concerns about technological changes — such as AI — leading to a structural shift in the number of people employed.

Despite a decade of worry about automation, the unemployment rate in 2022 was the lowest for almost five decades, and the percentage of participation in the workforce is at almost the highest level on record.

But will it stay there?

'How many people are in meaningless jobs': UBI advocate

""People are going to lose their jobs and we're going to have to find a way through the transition and a UBI actually offers us that opportunity,"" he says.

""It will make sure, not only that people have the money to live, it will mean that money then circulates through the economy and supports the businesses that will otherwise miss out on sales.""

He's not alone. Tesla and SpaceX tech billionaire Elon Musk is an advocate, even though he would probably be one of those most heavily taxed to fund a UBI.

""I think ultimately we will have to have some kind of universal basic income, I don't think we're going to have a choice,"" he told an audience in 2017.

This year, he said AI would eliminate most human jobs.

Already, many jobs could be automated.

But our thin safety net (for example, Australia's unemployment benefits are amongst the lowest in the OECD) means political and personal pressure to maintain employment.

Farming communities are identified as particularly vulnerable, with increased drought, variable rainfall and aridity impacting Tasmania, the Murray-Darling Basin and NSW.

At 3.0 degrees Celsius of warming, heat-related mortality is expected to increase by 146 per cent in Launceston.

Heatwaves are also expected to intensify, increasing from 2-4 severe or extreme heatwave days a year at 1.2 degrees of global warming, to up to 20 per year at 3 degrees of warming.

According to the assessment, flooding of the North and South Esk rivers combined with storm tides along the kanamaluka/Tamar estuary makes Launceston vulnerable to compound flooding — a flood risk that will ""increase with climate change"".

Investigations found 5,340 current and former employees, mostly in casual non-teaching roles, had been underpaid wages and superannuation amounting to $6.6 million between 2014 and 2024.

Ombudsman Anna Booth said UOW underpaid employees' weekend penalty rates, public holiday pay, overtime rates, various leave entitlements, and entitlements related to redundancy, severance and retirement.

Established in 1951, the University of Wollongong is attended by over 33,000 students. (ABC Illawarra: Justin Huntsdale)

She said it also failed to pay employees the minimum engagement period of at least three hours per shift.

""Back payments to impacted employees range from less than $20 to more than $36,000,"" Ms Booth said.

The ombudsman blamed poor governance and fundamental payroll system issues for the errors, which affected staff employed in administration as IT officers, librarians and researchers.

""We discovered that the university didn't set up its payroll system in a way that would ensure its employees received their correct entitlements under their enterprise agreement,"" Ms Booth said.

Formal rectification

While the majority of back payments had already been made, Ms Booth said UOW had been unable to locate and back-pay about 200 former employees.

She said implementing the EU was an important way of monitoring compliance and deterring other universities from making similar mistakes.

""It's really important to set universities up for success,"" Ms Booth said.

""Making these commitments means we can monitor as [UOW] futureproofs its payroll and general compliance with Fair Work laws in the future.""

As part of the EU a consultative body will be engaged to collaborate between university management, employees and the union on an ongoing basis.

Meanwhile, relevant staff will be required to complete training regarding their Fair Work obligations.

""The enforceable undertaking is in place until essentially the whole situation is rectified,"" Ms Booth said.

A second contrition, or ""apology"" payment according to Ms Booth, is still being finalised.

University 'accepts full responsibility'

In a statement UOW vice-president of operations Stephen Phillips issued a ""sincere apology to all those affected"".

""We deeply regret the distress and inconvenience caused to our staff by these errors,"" Mr Phillips said.

""We are committed to fully remedying these underpayments and continue to work proactively to strengthen our systems and processes so that staff can have absolute confidence in the accuracy of their pay now and in the future.""

Around 200 former staff haven't been repaid yet because UOW is yet to find them. (ABC Illawarra: Justin Huntsdale)

Ms Booth said underpaid employees was an issue seen across the university sector.

""Since 2022, in the 38 universities that we've had contact with, all of them in one way or another have been suffering a failure in governance and payroll systems,"" she said.

National Teritary Education Union president Alison Barnes described the underpayment as a ""disgraceful chapter in a $278 million national wage theft scandal"".

""The wage theft epidemic has been the canary in the coal mine of the broader governance disaster we're witnessing in our universities,"" Dr Barnes said in a statement.

"SA Water fined $60k for causing 'environmental harm' during botched maintenance of Warren Reservoir SA Water has been fined $60,000 for causing ""serious environmental harm"" during a botched maintenance effort at a Barossa Valley reservoir, which sent sludge into surrounding waterways.

The Environment Resources and Development Court issued the fine to the water utility — which is owned by the SA government — for polluting the waterways with grey clay silt when draining the Warren Reservoir, about 10 kilometres from Williamstown, in May 2023.

In a published judgement on the penalty, Senior Judge Michael Durrant said the incident ""caused actual and significant environmental harm to aquatic life by smothering what had been a rocky stream"".

He said the offence occurred when SA Water conducted maintenance on a leaking ""scour"" valve, which had not been used for 27 years, ""due to concerns it would not be able to be closed again"".

The reservoir, which was built between 1914 and 1916, holds about 4.7 gigalitres and supplies about 85,000 customers in the Barossa area.

Senior Judge Durrant said the valve was the lowest of three on the reservoir, which needed to be drained to less than five per cent, to undertake the works.

SA Water to face penalty over botched reservoir draining Photo shows A large body of blue water within a reservior SA Water is facing a criminal penalty for causing ""serious environmental harm"" when an engineer ignored a water quality test result while draining a Barossa Valley reservoir for maintenance work, a court has heard.

He said that during the ""complicated"" works, the valve was unable to be closed, and rain had caused the water levels to rise and continue to be drained into the South Para River.

""Simply put, the discharge downstream caused a very significant smothering, extending at least 650 metres to cover aquatic surfaces and aquatic insects and invertebrates with a fine layer of clay. Particularly, invertebrates were impacted,"" Senior Judge Durrant said.

""The sediment extended at least 1.7 kilometres downstream, covering surfaces and aquatic invertebrates with a fine layer of clay, with minor adverse effects on aquatic life and habitats being recorded at 2.9 kilometres downstream.""

He said the plan that was in place to handle any errors in the process was ""not followed"" and that ""human error"" had occurred.

He said attempts to stop the flow of silt were made, but it was not until a week later that a bung was installed, and two weeks until the valve was successfully closed.

""What resulted from this incident was serious environmental harm,"" Senior Judge Durrant said.

The court had previously heard that the SA Water knew that the release of sediment was ""one of the main risks to the environment"" of the maintenance works and that the ""inaction as a result of assumptions made by the SA Water staff on the ground was a lack of opportunity … to mitigate that damage"".

Senior Judge Durrant said SA Water had so far spent $661,000 on remediation works, while further monitoring of the harmed waterway would continue until June 2027, taking the total remediation costs to $953,000.

He said SA Water had accepted full responsibility for its actions, was remorseful and had reported the incident to the Environment Protection Authority, as it was ""obliged"" to do.

"Forestry industry says it can meet demand for biofuels as climate targets near South Australia's forestry industry says it can turn its timber waste into aviation and shipping fuel as part of the country's move away from diesel fuels.

The federal government has placed the development and implementation of biofuels as a key pillar of its 2035 climate targets.

It also announced the $1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels Program to support the development and manufacturing of low carbon liquid fuels.

South Australian Forest Products Association chief executive Nathan Paine said partnering with biofuel manufactures allowed the sector to reduce waste.

Nathan Paine says the sector has been looking for the best way to manage ""residue"". (ABC South East SA: Sam Bradbrook)

He said forestry residue, created after timber logs were manufactured, was often heaped together and burned.

""The ambition is to utilise every stick of fibre domestically,"" Mr Paine said.

""We're very optimistic agreements … will go a very long way to using the leftover residue that industry can utilise.""

Forestry deal reached

OneFortyOne owns 80,000 hectares of pine plantations in the Green Triangle region, between south-east SA and south-west Victoria, and operates a sawmill in Mount Gambier.

This week it reached an agreement with biofuel developer HAMR energy to supply forestry waste to be converted into low-carbon methanol at its future site in Portland, Victoria.

The agreement will see OneFortyOne supply timber waste for research and development for the first two years.

""You grow these trees for 30 years or longer and you want to make sure that you get the most out of it over that entire time period,"" said the director of strategy and corporate development Nick Chan.

"" Every thing you can do to ensure you minimise the waste is only going to add to the value of those trees. ""

HAMR's proposed Portland site is expected to be completed in about two years, once the initial research phase with OneFortyOne is complete.

""Getting this agreement in place is an important milestone in the development phase in the project, helping attract potential customers and investors who will be key to bringing the facility online,"" he said.

Mr Stribley said the Cleaner Fuels Program had given the burgeoning biofuels sector confidence.

""Transitioning society's use of fossil liquid fuels, along with bringing fuel production back onshore in Australia, is a huge undertaking,"" he said.

Biofuels, electrification, to drive transport

University of the Sunshine Coast Forestry Research Institute director Mark Brown has been working with forestry industries around the world to work with biofuel programs.

He said while last week's announcement pushed biofuels into the spotlight, forestry had been investigating the area for decades.

""[It's] the ability to produce a fuel that's effectively the same as the fossil-based fuels used today and drop that into existing technology,"" Professor Brown said.

"Planned sale of RAC WA's insurance arm to IAG sparks member disquiet amid jump in profit The head of Western Australia's biggest insurer says having a Sydney-based owner is the ""best path forward"" for its customers, despite some threatening to leave if the acquisition goes ahead.

The Royal Automobile Club of WA (RAC) is looking to sell its insurance operations to Insurance Australia Group Ltd (IAG) in a $1.35 billion deal, which the national consumer watchdog is reviewing.

RAC's insurance products and services are the backbone of its business, which generated $290 million in net income last financial year.

The company recorded a net profit of $255 million — more than double last year's earnings.

'Best path forward'

RAC Group CEO Rob Slocombe said IAG had agreed to maintain a WA workforce, at least initially.

RACWA sells insurance operations to IAG Photo shows A shot of the RAC logo on Perth Arena. RACWA has announced a 20-year deal with insurance company Insurance Australia Group, handing over its entire insurance underwriting business.

""Over time that may change as more technology comes in and various things change, but IAG has committed to keeping a significant claims handling presence here in Western Australia,"" he told ABC Radio Perth.

Mr Slocombe said he believed the deal was in the best interests of WA customers, but said he was unable to provide details about how.

""We're very confident this partnership is the best path forward … we'll continue to cooperate with the ACCC but there's a limited amount I can say while they're still deliberating,"" he said.

Customers threaten to walk

But some customers and long-time members say they are considering taking their business elsewhere if IAG takes over RAC's insurance business.

""Last year my premium went up about $30-$40 to my surprise … never had an accident, never made a claim,"" customer Cameron told ABC Radio Perth.

Customers say they are concerned about the planned sale of RAC WA's insurance arm to Sydney-based IAG. (ABC News: West Matteeussen)

""It was good to be able to go in and talk to someone, they were really helpful … maybe I will be looking at other insurance options [if the deal goes ahead].""

Another member, George, said he was not convinced by Mr Slocombe's pitch.

""How gullible do you have to be to believe that bloke? He's only saying what he has to say,"" he told ABC Radio Perth.

""As soon as RAC change, I'm going elsewhere.""

Mr Slocombe said RAC would be considering ""new business areas and opportunities"", pointing to the company's existing caravan parks, resorts and road safety education programs.

Competition concerns

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has flagged serious concerns the deal would likely substantially reduce competition in WA's insurance market.

The ACCC said a merger would make it unlikely for any new insurance provider to be able to compete against IAG, and also raised potential concerns about IAG's ability to shut off access to cost-effective repairers for other insurance providers.

RAC Group CEO Rob Slocombe says the group will seek new business opportunities outside insurance. (Supplied: RAC)

The potential reduction in competition would lead to higher premiums for insurance, and less choice for customers, according to the Motor Trades Association of Australia.

The acquisition proposal comes after IAG acquired 90 per cent of the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland's insurance business earlier this year.

IAG chief executive Nick Hawkins has previously said the company was committed to serving and protecting West Australians.

""We continue to believe the alliance with RAC builds on our shared heritage as mutuals, and strong sense of customer and community,"" he said.

The ACCC is set to announce its verdict on the proposal on November 27.

"Three Australians lay dead as investors of Optus's parent company Singtel were buying up its shares The word ""sorry"" has little meaning if you know there is a possibility you will transgress again.

Ideally, after saying sorry, you then make every effort to ensure the mistake is not repeated.

If a company makes several missteps over a number of years, you could reasonably assume the management is either incompetent or negligent.

These words are now being used by industry experts to describe a provider of crucial telecommunications infrastructure in Australia.

The actions by Optus management in the hours following a series of failed attempts by its customers to call triple-0 raise questions about the telco's fitness to operate in Australia.

But who's really pulling the strings at Optus?

Optus's network outage last week has cost several lives. (AAP: Erik Anderson)

I'm telling you for the last time

I think you can safely assume that Optus has needed crisis management experts on speed dial in recent years.

Earlier this year, Optus Mobile admitted — following court action brought by the ACCC — to engaging in unconscionable conduct when selling telecommunications goods and services to hundreds of customers.

The sales practice, imposed on more than 400 customers at 16 different stores across Australia, occurred between August 2019 and July 2023.

Optus's practices revealed in Federal Court Photo shows close up sign of Optus The Federal Court has heard vulnerable Optus customers who were homeless, unemployed or receiving disability payments were wrongfully sold services and products.

Many vulnerable people — and those experiencing disadvantage — were sold phones or signed up to contracts they did not want or need or couldn't afford or use, the watchdog found.

The ACCC and Optus agreed the telco should pay a $100 million penalty.

In 2022, Optus suffered a cyber attack that affected the data of around 9.5 million Australians.

And on November 8, 2023, Optus experienced a nationwide network outage that caused significant disruption across Australia for individuals and businesses, including access to triple-0 calls.

The ACMA found Optus failed to provide access to the emergency call service for 2,145 people during the outage.

After Optus was fined for this in 2024, the public was assured it would not happen again.

On Friday evening, after Optus announced another network upgrade that affected 600 customers' ability to access the triple-0 emergency service was linked to three deaths, a reporter reminded Optus CEO Stephen Rue of his promise last year.

He replied, ""I share your frustration.""

Radio silence

What's curious, though, is the lack of communication — ironic for a telecommunications company — in the hours following the time we know customer complaints first began to surface.

The reporter above asked Mr Rue: ""Do you have any idea what may have happened?""

More customers caught in triple-0 failure as Optus awaits 'consequences' Photo shows a woman with brown hair speaking in front of a blue and green background The Australian Media and Communications Authority begins its investigation into the Optus triple-0 outage that has been linked to deaths in South Australia and Western Australia.

He replied: ""The facts are still being established.""

This comment from Mr Rue was made approaching 48 hours since the incident occurred, following a similar problem years earlier.

We now know several Optus customers called an offshore call centre on Thursday morning to complain about not being able to reach triple-0 services.

So, what was Optus doing between before midday on Thursday, September 18, and 5:44pm AEST on Friday evening, when the CEO spoke at a snap media conference that was due to start at 5:30pm?

""We have been establishing the facts,"" Mr Rue told reporters.

"" We have established [today] what I've told you. ""

Mr Rue told reporters it was ""standard process"" to first restore the triple-0 service, which it did, then undertake welfare checks.

The CEO then said it was decided, assumingly among Optus management and its communications team, to speak to the media once the ""welfare checks"" had been completed.

Three people had died trying to access the emergency triple-0 service on Thursday morning using Optus telecommunications, and by midday the following day, the Australian public was none the wiser.

Experts scratching their heads

Corporate governance expert Thomas Clarke said the sequence of events between Thursday AM and Friday evening that were offered up by CEO Stephen Rue simply didn't add up.

Professor Clarke told The Business that Optus should have informed the Australian public — one way or another — within minutes of hearing triple-0 calls for some customers had not been successful.

Optus should have responded much quicker after the incident, experts say. (AAP: Bianca De Marchi)

The company did not need to confirm the results of 600 welfare checks before making a public disclosure that something was amiss.

""[Optus should have made an announcement] I would say minutes, and if not minutes, certainly within an hour or two [of the incident],"" UTS professor and corporate governance expert Thomas Clarke said.

"" Both the emergency services and the general public should be fully briefed on what's occurring. ""

Veteran investment manager Roger Montgomery agreed with that.

""[Optus needed to update the market] as it happened, unless it was possible prior,"" he said.

Telecommunications consultant Paul Budde agreed with Thomas Clarke and Roger Montgomery.

All telcos need to lift their game after Optus failure Photo shows Optus graphic The latest Optus outage has pulled back the curtain on an alarming reality.

""Absolutely [the company should have disclosed the information immediately],"" he said.

Marcus Today senior portfolio manager Henry Jennings also agreed. He said the public (and by default investors) needed to be informed immediately following the incident.

""As soon as it became aware of the issue [the public should have been notified],"" Mr Jennings said.

""[It's] more about the risks to the public than the risks to shareholders.""

Where is Singtel?

What's also being missed in this discussion is Singtel's role.

Optus is a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel).

It means Singtel — which is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX) — owns all of Optus's private equity.

Its board has a say in what Optus does, and what happens to Optus has flow-on effects to Singtel's corporate value or company valuation.

As of Friday evening, after the Singapore stock exchange had closed, Singtel had only forwarded Optus's media statement onto the SGX, where it was published.

Despite the deaths linked to failed Optus communications services, the Singtel share price closed Friday evening up 1.4 per cent.

The corporation's shareholders had not yet been officially informed of the deaths, or the fact Optus's upgrade had been met with catastrophic problems.

""[Singtel] had a responsibility not only to immediately investigate what was happening in Australia but also to inform its investors of what is a market material matter,"" Professor Thomas Clarke said.

Singtel may well have been working behind the scenes to establish what went wrong, but this was not disclosed to the financial markets.

""I think that that would be a very irresponsible decision,"" Thomas Clarke said.

A former triple-0 operator has detailed the distressing moment she could not reach emergency services when her mother became trapped under her mobility scooter during the company's 13-hour outage.

""I assume it was negligence rather than a conscious decision not to inform the shareholders on Friday.""

As at the time of writing this column, the Singapore Stock Exchange has not published anything further on its site regarding Singtel or Optus.

At one point, during trade on Monday, Singtel's share price had fallen close to 2 per cent.

The ABC has asked Singtel to clarify what public communications it has made since Thursday morning.

It shouldn't have happened

While analysts agree the incident relates to an ""operational"" matter, it goes much deeper than that.

""It's an operational problem,"" Thomas Clarke says, ""but the board of directors of Optus has a responsibility to regularly review its emergency [systems].""

"" This is a wake-up call, not just for the telecoms corporations of Australia, but indeed the globe. ""

You see, the problem we have is that mobile services and communications dominate our lives.

It means smart devices now play a critical role in our safety.

Despite this, the industry is dominated by a few big corporate players.

Three people died after Optus network failure impacted triple-0 calls Photo shows close up sign of Optus Three people have died, including an eight-week-old baby, after a technical failure impacted hundreds of triple-0 calls on the Optus network.

Optus has the second-largest share of the mobile subscriber market in Australia, with roughly 24 per cent of the pie.

Telstra is the largest with 57 per cent share, followed by TPG Telecom.

Paul Budde believes Optus is now becoming accountable for chronic ""underinvestment"" in infrastructure.

""[Optus's] infrastructure was not up to scratch.

""[The outage was a] symptom of an underlying problem of underinvestment."" He said.

As it stands, it's a lottery now as to who will be a telecommunication provider's next victim.

"The government says its 2035 climate targets are achievable but mathematics suggests a different story The problem with an emissions reduction target, necessary though it is, is that its mere existence implies it is achievable and that if we do achieve it, we will be fine.

New CSIRO modelling suggests Australia's new targets are difficult to achieve, and even if they are, we won't be fine.

Australia will not hit the targets of 62-70 per cent reduction by 2035 and net zero by 2050 because the logistics of doing so require new forests the size of half of Victoria to be grown in 10 years, followed by further forests the size of two Tasmanias.

These plantations are not to be grown in the outback, either, but on existing farmland near the coast.

CSIRO modelling — released at the same time as the new government target on Thursday and on which it is based — shows that if Australia's net emissions are to be between 62 and 70 per cent below 2005 levels by 2035, we will need to remove 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the air.

That is what will be required to offset one-third of the 300 million tonnes of carbon that we will still be emitting by then.

By 2050, my calculations suggest the removals will have to total 150 million tonnes per year to offset all of the emissions still going, so we can achieve net zero.

We need millions more trees

Until scientists come up with something else, the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is largely done by forests.

A planted forest in a reasonably fertile region in Australia eats about 10 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year over its first 25 years.

This means the 100 million tonnes of sequestration needed by 2035 would require at least 10 million hectares of land to be covered by new trees, or about half the size of Victoria.

Climate change forces BOM to overhaul El Niño and La Niña analysis Photo shows Storm clouds drop heavy rain in the distance on a western Queensland property The Bureau of Meteorology is making a major change to how they assess El Niño and La Niña, the world's most dominant drivers of weather variability.

Removing 150 million tonnes of CO2 per year by 2050 would require 15 million hectares of forest, which is a bit more than twice the size of Tasmania.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese did not mention half of Victoria and two Tasmanias being covered by trees when he announced the ""achievable"" 2035 and 2050 targets last week.

At the moment, most of the sequestration is coming from scrappy forests in the outback and from wetter forests near the coast that are eating more carbon than before because of the decline of logging native forests.

But the inadequate sequestration in the outback will stop when the landscape dries, as it will, and might even go backwards. The sequestration of carbon from the decline of native forest harvesting is a one-off gain.

The most straightforward way to achieve the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that the CSIRO and, therefore, the government will be relying on is to plant billions of trees on productive agricultural land around the east and west coasts of Australia.

This farmland is currently used to grow wheat, canola and grapes, or is where cattle are pastured.

That scenario suggests Australia's agricultural sector would shrink dramatically. The land will be needed for forests.

EVs won't save us

You and the Coalition might now be thinking, well, we can get actual emissions down to less than 300 million tonnes in 2035 and 150 million tonnes in 2050 by using nuclear power or something, so we won't need as many trees.

Think again.

The mammoth task ahead to reach the 2035 target Photo shows Anthony Albanese close up, with Chris Bowen in background. Getting to even the bottom end of the government's 62 to 70 per cent emissions reduction target by 2035 will require drastic increases to solar and wind power capacity, electric vehicle take-up and an extension of the safeguard mechanism, according to the Climate Change Authority.

The CSIRO figures also assume electricity generation is 86 per cent carbon-free by 2035 and 92 per cent by 2050. The modelling assumes no coal is used at all and includes some residual gas generation. There is no nuclear energy.

Other assumptions used in the CSIRO modelling include electric vehicles being 100 per cent of car sales; two-thirds of freight transport is electrified by 2050, and the other third uses biofuels; and that ""decarbonisation in air transport and shipping … accelerates in the 2030s as hydrogen carriers and sustainable aviation fuels become commercialised.""

In other words, the targets of 62-70 per cent by 2035 and net zero by 2050 require a cracking pace of decarbonisation of electricity and transport. Not only is that a lot faster than we're achieving now, but it requires using fuels that haven't been commercialised yet and adding billions of trees to replace farms as well.

And that's before we ask an even more fundamental question: is 62-70 per cent enough?

The answer is likely to be no.

America is out of the game

In July, the Climate Council published a report that said the only way to avoid 2 degrees Celsius of global warming, as agreed in Paris in 2015, was for Australia to be net zero by 2035, and the world to be net zero by 2040, not 2050.

The Climate Council is indeed an advocacy group, but the Australian Academy of Science holds the same view.

The 2 degrees Celsius of warming appears to be baked in, as no country in the world is trying to be net zero by 2040.

Climate solutions are already at work Photo shows A number of wind turbines in a desert landscape at dusk with a full moon rising We don't have to wait for moonshot technologies to reach our climate targets. Most of the solutions to the climate crisis are already around us.

In fact, even if current global targets are met, and only the smallest of them will be met, the warming trajectory suggests the world is heading for a 2.5 degree Celsius temperature rise.

America is out of the game entirely. The Trump administration calls the whole thing a scam and continues to push fossil fuels, daring the climate gods to do their worst.

China's 2030 target is 65 per cent, and in the first six months of this year, it installed twice as much solar capacity as the rest of the world combined.

But while China's 2035 target will probably be higher than 65 per cent, it won't be 100 per cent.

The other big emitter, India, is going for a 45 per cent reduction in emissions intensity, which is not emissions but carbon dioxide as a proportion of GDP, so they've effectively given up as well.

In general, as discussed here last week, the global targets are disorderly and inconsistent.

The future reality is unclear

Earlier last week, the Albanese government released two further reports assessing the environment: a National Risk Assessment and a National Adaptation Plan.

Both come up short.

The risk assessment purports to model 1.5, 2, and 3 degrees Celsius of warming, but it is not spelled out clearly enough what exactly happens in each of those scenarios.

Broadly, it's fair to say that 2 degrees will be terrible for the environment and 3 degrees will be catastrophic. Scientists have been telling us this for years.

But the National Risk Assessment does not spell out the likelihood of each scenario.

Remote communities struggling with heat Photo shows A yellow sun rises into a red sky over the ocean Locals in small northern WA communities say the potential dangers identified by the Climate Risk Assessment are already starting to appear.

Research suggests the planet has already warmed by up to 1.5 degrees Celsius, so the odds of that are 100 per cent, but what are the odds of 2 and 3 degrees? They don't know, or are not saying.

It surely means the Adaptation Plan was drawn up in the dark. To what extent do we need to adapt to global warming? Should we adapt to bad, terrible, or catastrophic conditions?

Without probabilities to work from, the National Adaptation Plan lacks direction.

The headline number at the top of the report is $3.6 billion ""committed to adaptation and resilience measures since 2022 and around $9 billion out to 2030 committed to policies and programs that are helping support broader efforts"".

Those amounts include the addition of existing programmes cobbled together in a long list that looks impressive yet reflects a fraction of the $30 billion that the Insurance Council of Australia says is needed.

The centrepiece is a Disaster Ready Fund of $1 billion over five years, or $200 million a year. This amount not only feels hopelessly inadequate, but the government is struggling to spend it as they wait for the states to submit projects.

Insufficient applications are arriving, and those that have been submitted are often small community projects such as storm water drains and guttering on scout halls.

Addressing 2 degrees of warming in the northern rivers region of NSW, for example, will require a complete rethink involving a combination of levees and moving town centres, as well as housing, to higher ground.

With 3 degrees of warming, it's unlikely that anyone will be able to live in those floodplains at all. North of Brisbane, residents will face frequent cyclones, and anyone living near forests will experience bushfires. Those within a kilometre of the sea will see expanded coastal erosion.

Amanda McKenzie, the CEO of the Climate Council, told me last week that 3 degrees would mean 50-degree Celsius days occurring regularly, which would cost 4 percentage points of GDP because the equivalent of 700,000 days of outdoor work would be lost every year.

A complete rethink of household insurance would also be needed. The National Risk Assessment says some 10 per cent of Australian houses, or about one million homes, will be uninsurable, and many of the rest will see prohibitive increases in premiums.

The government might need to introduce something resembling Medicare for household insurance — that is, a basic level of insurance funded by a levy that lasts until enough mitigation work has been done.

The insurance question

Ten years ago, the UK government created a body called Flood Re as a partnership with the insurance industry to provide guaranteed reinsurance for flood claims. The scheme ends in 2039, by which time enough levees are expected to be built to ensure it won't be needed.

Australia has far bigger and deeper floods than the UK. An Australian flood reinsurer would need to be better funded and last longer, but something like it is the sort of adaptation that could be needed for flood and bushfire-prone regions.

Australia's refugee program may also need to be rethought to incorporate people displaced by climate disasters from the Pacific and countries like Bangladesh.

The underlying problem is that government policy for global warming is not just about the impact in Australia. It is everywhere. And it assumes that the effort to prevent climate change will work.

Politicians — and scientists — are ""optimistic"" to keep our spirits up, and their own.

For example, Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen spruiked last week as he released the new 2035 target: ""This is an ambitious but achievable target … and it presents Australia with an enormous economic and jobs opportunity.""

The approach suggests not only will everything be fine, but it'll be great!

But that is not an attitude designed to produce careful risk management and prepare for the worst.

"Breastfeeding in public is protected in Australia. So why are mothers still facing discrimination? While breastfeeding her one-year-old poolside on a cruise ship, a comment from a stranger caught India Gladwood off guard.

""A man walked past, he was probably in his 60s, gave me the dirtiest look that I've ever received and said 'disgusting,'"" says the 32-year-old from Gympie, home of the Kabi Kabi people.

""I'm glad I was a fair way into my breastfeeding journey, because if I had only been starting out, I think I wouldn't be able to feed in public at all. I would worry everyone felt this way.""

Last week Elise Turner from the Gold Coast was asked to leave Virgin Australia's Melbourne lounge by a staff member because she was pumping breast milk.

Dr Turner posted on social media that when trying to defend her right to breastfeed in a public space, the Virgin employee said she was ""making her and other people uncomfortable"".

Under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, it's unlawful to discriminate against a woman because she is breastfeeding, and that includes expressing.

Victoria Marshall-Cerins, executive officer at the Australian Breastfeeding Association, says while there is a level of awareness that breastfeeding in public is protected, some people in the community still view it as ""inappropriate"".

""We know from research many women still experience negative behaviours when breastfeeding in public.

""Disapproving looks, critical comments, and … unwanted touching.""

She says the stigma around breastfeeding in public influences parent's behaviour, impacting breastfeeding rates, and changes to community awareness and attitudes are needed.

Breastfeeding in public comes with 'social rules'

Ms Marshall-Cerins says some breastfeeding parents expect their right to breastfeed in public to be challenged.

""And even when it is recognised as a right, there are still social rules that regulate how it should be done appropriately.""

A 2019 Australian study shows breastfeeding mothers feel pressure to meet social conditions when feeding in public, such as being discreet and covering up.

They found women felt they had to ""feed in an appropriate place to avoid discomforting others, guard against judgement, and to protect herself from the unwanted male gaze"".

India says while she knew she wasn't doing anything wrong when feeding her son by the pool, the comment from a stranger made her feel angry and ashamed.

""I was just feeding my baby — he was having his lunch, I was reading my book. It was our holiday.""

Ms Marshall-Cerins says community attitudes towards breastfeeding in public contribute to a drop in breastfeeding rates.

""We have incredibly high breastfeeding initiation rates in Australia — just under 96 per cent of new mums are giving breastfeeding a go.

""By the three to five month mark, the percentages drop off really sharply [to 15 per cent being exclusively breastfed].""

""Not enough breastmilk for child"" and ""return to work"" are examples of other reasons caregivers cite for not continuing breastfeeding.

While people like Dr Turner feel empowered to advocate for themselves when challenged, Ms Marshall-Cerins says many women don't.

""For every Elise Turner, there are many other women who just accept the experience.""

More knowledge around lactation needed

Breastfeeding specialist Lisa Amir from La Trobe University says a greater understanding of lactation physiology could improve the experiences of women breastfeeding and expressing in public.

""If someone is lactating, the breasts are producing milk 24/7. They can't just wait until it's a convenient time for them to breastfeed or express.""

In addition to feeding her baby, a mother may need to express her breasts to prevent negative consequences such as mastitis.

""Or if she is not able to express frequently, milk production reduces.""

Your stories of breastfeeding in public Photo shows Nicole and her youngest breastfeeding in the pool While some caregivers told us they don't hesitate to breastfeed in shared spaces, others explained it isn't always straightforward.

Ms Marshall-Cerins says many people don't have lived experience with breastfeeding and therefore aren't aware of what normal infant feeding patterns look like, especially in young babies.

""Babies can be feeding anywhere from eight to 14 times a day.

""Breastfeeding in public is not necessarily the choice the community may think it is.

""It's simply a mother responding to baby's needs and cues.""

Aside from hydration and nutrition, breastfeeding also offers babies physical and emotional comfort.

The sexual objectification of breasts

Breastfeeding is a pro-social and pro-health behaviour, says Ms Marshall-Cerins. (Pexels)

Ms Marshall-Cerins says breasts being viewed as sexual rather than maternal creates a taboo where breastfeeding can be seen as ""anti-social behaviour"".

""It's seen as something that should be done in private.""

She says breastfeeding is a pro-social and pro-health behaviour, and ""I don't know that we've really grasped that as a community"".

""It is one of the best preventative health measures a parents can take to make sure baby has the best start to life.

""And from a women's health perspective, breastfeeding women are safeguarding their own health [such as] … reduction in risk of some reproductive cancers like breast cancer.

""We are stigmatising a pro-health behaviour that is contributing to relieving the health burden of society in general.""

Most people are supportive

Professor Amir has researched Australian attitudes towards breastfeeding in public and says while negative reactions are rare, women do fear them.

Her research found that 85 per cent of people were in support of breastfeeding in public, while 10 per cent were ""conditionally supportive"", citing expectations like breasts being covered, and 5 per cent were unsupportive.

While some women may prefer to use a cover while breastfeeding, others feel pressured to do so. (Pexels)

Ms Marshall-Cerins says women should feel confident to breastfeed in public, and if you are challenged, ""there are many things that Elise Turner did that we would suggest.""

""Talk to the person who is challenging you, about how this is a protected right.

""[Say] that you are happy where you are, and your baby is happy where you are feeding.

""And look to anyone around you to try and connect with them, and see if you can get some support so you don't feel isolated.""",Breastfeeding in public is protected in Australia.

"How #RedundancyDiaries are busting the stigma of being let go When Camille returned to work after an overseas holiday earlier this year, she was called into an ominous meeting.

""I was told my role may be made redundant,"" says the 41-year-old from Karratha/home to the Ngarluma and Yindjibarndi people in WA.

A week later, Camille, who asked us not to use her surname for privacy, was given two options: take a package or seek redeployment within the organisation.

Camille, who was working in health, safety and environment, took the redundancy and says it was a difficult process.

She began sharing her experiences on TikTok via the #RedundancyDiaries trend, hopeful to normalise it for others.

""[Redundancy] has this real stigma, because it's veiled in secrecy, people have a sense of shame and that they've done something wrong.

"" It feels very personal, when it actually isn't. ""

The shock and shame of redundancy

Exactly how many Australians face redundancy each year is unknown, but the Australian Financial Review reported almost 23,000 were let go in reported redundancy rounds in 2023.

It's likely higher, given employers only need to notify Services Australia when they lay off more than 15 staff.

Young Australians being made redundant Photo shows Young blonde man taking a selfie in an elevator. He is smiling and doing a peace sign with hand. Younger workers are more likely than older people to be sacked or made redundant. So what should you do if this happens to you?

Kathryn Page, an organisational psychologist and adjunct professor in leadership at Swinburne University, says while redundancies are usually strategic business decisions, people can take it personally.

Dr Page, who has also experienced redundancy, says feelings of shock can be followed by rejection, denial, anger, and grief.

Career Development Association Australia (CDAA) national president Kate Flaherty says people may even feel anxious or afraid.

""They might be worried about finances, will they get another job, are their skills transferable?""

Some people, however, see redundancy as the chance for a fresh start.

""Other people say, 'This is a really great opportunity, because I was wanting another job, and now I've got a package and breathing space' [to find one],"" Ms Flaherty says.

Normalising the experience and sharing tips

Camille has been focusing on other things since being made redundant, like her singing. (Supplied)

Camille says instead of taking ""garden leave"" (when someone is still employed and paid during their notice period but isn't required to come in or perform duties), she opted to work the remainder of her notice period.

It's a decision she spoke about in depth via her #RedundancyDiaries.

""I would not make that same decision again. It had a negative impact on my mental health,"" she says.

Dr Page says #RedundancyDiaries can help people see the real process of being laid off.

""It gives that more practical advice — sometimes people don't know how to navigate redundancy.""

She says it's also a way people can build community, especially when they might be feeling dejected or isolated.

""It gives people hope as well.

""They see, 'Oh well, if this can happen to someone like you, then maybe it's OK it happened to me.'""

Those sharing their experience online may also be able to network and find new opportunities that way, says Ms Flaherty.

""Their network is the best way of getting back out there.""

Where to now?

Camille has spoken about what she would do differently if made redundant again. (Supplied)

After she decided to take a redundancy, Camille began applying for jobs and was lucky to be offered a role.

""I had a job offer and it was really good, but I got off the phone and just had this real sinking feeling saying, 'I don't want to do this.'""

Camille realised she was burnt out and needed to take some time to recover.

""We are so conditioned to hustle and work. I'm very fortunate I can do this — but I did the maths and I can afford to take a break.""

Shifting to part-time work Photo shows Koren Helbig sits at her dining table with a raised laptop, keyboard and mouse, working from home. Working long hours had left me feeling exhausted and burnt out. Making an effort to be thrifty has allowed me to work part time.

Camille has been focusing on her music career, participating in local theatre and tending to a few side hustles, like selling second-hand items online.

Dr Page says for people who are made redundant, it's best to ""take a breath"".

""Acknowledge the feelings, but don't act on them all, necessarily.

""How you are feeling right now is not how you will feel when you look back.""

Ms Flaherty says when looking for a new job, reflect on your skills and how they are transferable.

She says sometimes we do so much on autopilot, we can't see what our skills are within the tasks we complete.

""Go to people you have worked with, and ask them: 'Give me a reflection of my skills, those things I had forgotten about.'""

Reach out to contacts for support and networking, refresh your resume and get up to speed with application processes.

""And be kind to yourself when you apply for jobs.

"As a doctor I'm choosing self-care over resilience Over the course of my late-life medical degree, I coined the snazzy phrase, ""First do no harm begins with self-care"".

It was a play on the Hippocratic oath, designed to empower some of the other, much younger students to look after themselves throughout a high-pressure degree.

Despite regularly advocating for healthy personal and professional boundaries, I wrapped up that degree surprisingly unwell.

Powering on

By final year, my energy levels had declined and I'd noticed a raft of changes in my body.

Being a mature-aged student (I was 40 at the time), I told myself I was just getting old. But as we approached graduation, that thought struck a vein of terror. If the perils of age were troubling me this much at medical school, how was I going to survive internship?

Midway through our final exams, I got home from a comedy gig I was performing at and had a funny turn (so to speak). My health deteriorated sharply after that but I powered on.

I applied for special consideration for the exams but didn't have a diagnosis to share at that point, just the vagaries of being very unwell and a medical certificate from a local pharmacist in lieu of my fully booked GP.

In the dark as much as I was, the medical school rejected my application.

Despite this, I passed my exams but then ended up in hospital, pale and exhausted, where we finally got to the bottom of things. A benign but nasty tumour had been lurking at the base of my brain and wreaking health havoc for the preceding year or two.

It turned out that funny turn was the tumour bleeding into my skull.

I made it through exams but wound up in hospital where they found the cause of my ""funny turn"" and subsequent health issues. (Supplied: Roland Bull)

""You deserve the university medal for getting through exams with all this going on,"" said one of my new specialists a few weeks later.

I wore the statement like a badge of honour for months.

I felt preternaturally resilient: if I could get through medical school in the midst of a health crisis then surely, I could do anything.

All those thoughts of being less energetic and capable than my younger peers morphed into pride at being able to handle so much more than the average person.

Nonetheless, I postponed my internship for three months to get back on my feet.

The reprieve wasn't all smooth sailing as I packed up my house in Canberra, moved in with family in Queensland, got settled and then braced for Cyclone Alfred. But I was itching to commence life as a junior doctor so ignored my sub-optimal recovery and launched into work in April this year.

Human after all

I lasted two shifts then totally crashed, physically and mentally.

Tail between my legs, I had to admit I was human after all.

In fact, valuing resilience over adequate self-care had been a trap that set me back a few steps on the path to recovery.

While completing medical school that unwell was a notable achievement, it was also incredibly stupid. I'd navigated a dangerous health event in survival mode, but I couldn't live the rest of my life that way.

Why I turned down my dream job Photo shows Phoebe Thorburn stands behind a wooden kitchen bench with their hands on the benchtop, looking happy. Phoebe was offered a role that was perfect on paper, but the reality of what it entailed made them rethink what a ""dream job"" looks like.

Of course, that didn't stop me from feeling like an absolute failure for having to pause internship again so soon.

Happily, the extra time off gave room for some quiet contemplation. I can't help but think that, while it takes a lot of resilience to navigate a personal crisis, it takes even more to safeguard your health in a society that values testing your limits in pursuit of productivity.

Clearly, I still view self-care as indulgence, even though I bang on about it at every opportunity. But taking the time to be healthy and well before delving into something stressful is invaluable. I wish I'd done that rather than rushing into work before I was ready.

Watch the new season of The Assembly on ABC iview Photo shows A young person holding a microphone standing amongst audience. Leigh Sales returns to mentor a new cohort of autistic journalism students from across the country as they interview some of Australia's favourite celebrities.

Giving yourself permission to step back and breathe or to tread a different timeline to the people around you can prompt all kinds of apprehension, embarrassment and shame. I still feel each of those things from time to time as I carve out the necessary space to balance work and health.

I'm also still itching to progress my medical career, just as long as I'm well enough and have a plan in place to stay that way.

Being cognisant of my own wellbeing will make me a better doctor and make things safer for my patients.

Because first do no harm begins with self-care and all that.

"How to clean out your wardrobe as the seasons change Have you been avoiding cleaning your wardrobe?

It's the kind of task that can seem overwhelming. Something for next weekend or the weekend after perhaps.

If you're swapping out winter clothes for lighter ones this spring, it's the perfect opportunity to review exactly what's in your wardrobe.

Here are some simple ways to get started.

Declutter your wardrobe

Home organiser Pip Renfrew lives in Maitland, on the traditional lands of the Wonnarua people, and says people are sometimes blissfully unaware of how much clothing they own.

Pip Renfrew says when working with a small space, it’s important to use it all. (Supplied: Pip Renfrew)

She says an audit is in order if you're struggling for space.

""The items you didn't really wear over winter maybe kick them aside to sell or to donate.""

Emily Deneys works part-time as a stylist and fashion content creator in the central Victorian town of Castlemaine, on Dja Dja Wurrung country.

""If something sat there untouched [for the season], I ask myself why,"" she says.

""Do I already have something similar? Does it not fit right? Does it just need mending or dry cleaning? Or does it just not work for my lifestyle anymore?""

From there, she decides whether she should donate or sell the item.

Ms Deneys recommends the ""coat hanger trick"".

""Every time you wear something put it back on the rack with the hook turned the other way … you'll easily see what hasn't been touched.""

Jaimie Shiel is a disability advocate and wheelchair user who lives in Naarm/Melbourne and ""works to make fashion more inclusive"".

She describes her style as maximalist, which makes sharing a ""pretty standard sized cupboard"" with her partner challenging.

Ms Shiel approaches wardrobe decluttering in chunks so it's manageable.

She might get started by sorting a pyjama drawer or spending half an hour organising her T-shirts.

""Even if it takes two weeks to sort your whole cupboard out, it means that you have done it bit by bit instead of just putting it off and not ever getting it done.""

If something no longer fits, it's not allowed back into her wardrobe.

Sort and pack seasonal items away

If people have the space, Ms Renfrew suggests storing bulky jackets and jumpers that are no longer needed.

She has the caveat: ""I don't recommend hanging jumpers or knits because obviously they stretch.""

Tips for selling second-hand clothes online Photo shows Jo Bartley wearing a purple dress and sunnies If selling second-hand clothes online is more of an ambition than a reality, these tips from experienced sellers might encourage you to get listing.

Ms Renfrew says vacuum-sealed bags or plastic tubs are good options.

She also recommends checking clothing is clean before packing it away and storing it somewhere dry and cool.

Ms Renfrew says this helps protect the clothing from dust, damage and pests.

If you know the house has moths you may also want to include a moth repellent, such as moth sheets.

""If people have a room, put it on top of the wardrobe or under their bed"" and ""make sure it's all labelled so you know what's in there.""

The weather can still change, so Ms Deneys recommends not packing all warm items away.

""I always leave a few key pieces out from each season … so I have options for layering during those trans-seasonal months.""

Jaimie Shiel says pieces she's been neglecting get priority in the centre of her wardrobe to encourage her to wear them. (Supplied: Jaimie Shiel )

Use the space you have

Wardrobe space can be hard to come by and Ms Deneys recommends draw dividers, splitting hanging space with shelving or drawers, and grouping clothing by category and storing accessories where you can see them.

Watch the new season of The Assembly on ABC iview Photo shows A young person holding a microphone standing amongst audience. Leigh Sales returns to mentor a new cohort of autistic journalism students from across the country as they interview some of Australia's favourite celebrities.

Ms Shiel also prioritises pieces she hasn't worn in the middle of her cupboard as a priority rail to ensure everything gets worn.

Ms Renfrew says failing to use vertical space is a common mistake.

She recommends ""utilising the bottom half of your wardrobe"" by installing a double hanging rail or using some cube shelving or storage. It could also be used for shoe storage.

Ms Renfrew is not a fan of chunky wooden hangers if your wardrobe is crowded as they take up extra space and suggests slimline hangers instead.

Buy new items purposefully

Emily Deneys says, ""If I bring something new in, I need to let go of something else."" (Supplied: Emily Deneys )

Ms Deneys says she currently abides by a ""one in, one out rule"" when it comes to new acquisitions.

She says it's helped ""keep [her] consumption in check"".

"How to build a flourishing garden in a courtyard or smaller space As spring arrives, many of us look to the garden as a way to bring warmth, colour and life into our homes.

But not everyone has a sprawling backyard or perfect conditions for planting.

For some of us, getting enough sun can be a challenge, while others might be dealing with a courtyard or patio that needs some shade.

That doesn't mean you can't have a lush, vibrant garden.

Plan before you plant

Making the most of a small outdoor space comes down to clever planning and plant selection.

Matt Cantwell is a landscaper and the creative director of a Sydney based landscaping business on the lands of the Dharawal people. He says people often underestimate how tricky smaller spaces can be.

""It's funny, the amount of people who will contact us and say we've only got a little courtyard, it's pretty straightforward,"" he says.

"" It's actually completely the opposite, and it's often easier to design a much larger space than it is a smaller one. ""

Mr Cantwell recommends starting the process by considering your needs for the space.

""With a courtyard area, it becomes another room of the house — and it's often the largest.""

He says, typically, a courtyard will become the opposite space of the main one inside — if the main space indoors is dedicated to dining, the outdoor can become a lounge, or the other way around.

A back yard or courtyard ends up being another room of the house, so choosing what you use it for is important. (Unsplash)

Once you've decided what you want the space to be used for, it's about considering the all-important factor for planting, sunlight.

""You're always thinking about aspects of harnessing sun, particularly winter sun,"" Mr Cantwell says.

Once you've got the plan for what you want the space to be used for and have an idea of what to grow, it's about greening up the space.

Use vertical space

Adding height and greenery helps the space feel more vibrant, says Mr Cantwell, who recommends a climber in smaller areas.

""It could be having a custom planter at the top of the wall with plants that are going to hang down.

""Obviously green walls ... they're great, but they're also an expensive alternative compared to simply growing a climber on the wall, and they're also high maintenance,"" Mr Cantwell says.

Climbers like Chinese star jasmine are lower maintenance and offer dense foliage, while bougainvillea or pandorea add flowers for colour.

For all plants, check their sunlight needs and make sure you select those that are best for your space.

Climbers like bougainvillea help fill vertical space in gardens. (ABC)

He also suggests carefully chosen trees to bring shade without crowding the space.

""Something that's not too big … with a narrow, slender trunk with a canopy overhead and, ideally in many cases, the deciduous tree — one that's going to let sun in winter but provide you that shade in summer.""

He suggests options like crepe myrtles, Japanese myrtles, or ornamental pears can elevate a smaller garden.

Mr Cantwell also says pots are great for smaller spaces, and bigger pots chosen as statement pieces will both elevate the space and give the plants more room to grow.

Plants for shady spots

In dense urban areas, sunlight in backyards can be scarce, but that doesn't mean you have to forgo the foliage.

""Getting enough moisture, ornamental ferns like the silver lady fern or any kind of bold tropical type foliage like monstera or philodendrons and bromeliads are really great for shaded locations,"" Mr Cantwell says.

""Just head to your local nursery and [going] for the covered areas will get you nice bold foliage.""

Bromeliad varieties are a great option for a shady garden. (ABC)

Growing your own food

You can also turn your space into a productive edible garden.

Nature strip planting Photo shows A healthy vegetable patch with leafy greens grows beside a footpath in Melbourne, to depict how to plant a nature strip garden. Nature strip planting has many benefits but there are a few things to note before you begin.

Michael Wardle, a practising permaculture expert living in Brisbane's west/Tulmur, has done this with his balcony.

Vegetables typically need six to eight hours of sun a day, Mr Wardle explains, while fruiting plants like blueberries thrive in well-drained pots.

Because of the smaller space, Mr Wardle prioritises herbs and more expensive produce in his garden over cheap staples.

""I don't grow carrots, for example. The reason I don't grow carrots — I can pick up a pack of them for a dollar a kilo, whereas herbs, on the other hand, if I was to buy them from the shop, is something like $300 a kilo,"" he says.

On his balcony, he grows ""blueberries, lots of different herbs, I've got parsley, mint, coriander. I've also planted some marigolds to help bring in the beneficial insects, which help keep the pests under control.""

Marigolds are a good way to attract insects that help your garden and deter pests. (Supplied: Michael Wardle)

Using a small space, he says you need to pick what you prioritise.

""You've just got to be strategic,"" Mr Wardle says.

""Understand how much time you've got available, how much space you've got available, and how much time you have for management as well.

"" Consider what can you grow and then looking at the cost ratio analysis; what's the most expensive thing that you purchase compared to the cheapest? ""

Herbs need less sun than vegetables, making them easier to grow in shady spots. (Supplied: Michael Wardle)

Plants to avoid

A small space can become a hub for a busy home, so avoiding spiky or prickly plants can be a good idea, Mr Cantwell advises.

""Yucca, for example, they look really striking, but when you get close, you realise they have a pointed leaf and even some of the, you know, some ornamental grasses are even a little bit pointed,"" he says.

""So you want to make sure that unsuspecting visitors aren't going to get bitten because they get a little bit too close.""

Oversized trees can take away from the sunlight, which not only can impact your garden, but also you.

""It is so important to be able to receive sunlight at certain times of the day, and certain times of the year, not just for the benefit of the lower level plants, but just also for our mental health,"" Mr Cantwell says.

Ultimately, though, your space needs to suit you, and what you want to use it for, and your personality.

""You don't need a lot of planting to make it feel green and to make it feel like a garden.

"What are the best ways to clean windows and fly screens? If you avoid cleaning your windows and fly screens, you're likely putting off a task that's easier than you think.

We asked cleaning professionals for their tips on achieving a streak-free finish on windows and maintaining clean fly screens.

Use simple tools for the job

It can be tempting to splurge on special sprays and fancy tools for your windows, but some good-old-fashioned elbow grease and a couple of key pieces of equipment are all you really need.

Gold Coast/Yugambeh Country-based specialist bond cleaner Emma Morris says a high-quality squeegee is essential.

""You want to invest in something that's going to last long term, with the soft sponge on one side, and also a rubber back to squeegee the water and residue off the windows.""

She uses water with a little detergent and also a dry microfibre cloth.

""Go over the window with the soft side of the squeegee, squeegee it off with the rubber side, and the microfibre cloth just takes off any of those water marks that might be left … so there's a streak-free shine,"" she says.

Nick Palomo, a residential and commercial window cleaner who operates in Brisbane/Meanjin, also says a squeegee is his weapon of choice, and admits he ""never thought about using squeegees"" until he started cleaning windows professionally.

He uses microfibre sleeves, placed over a T-shaped bar, for the cleaning, then the squeegee to dry.

Mr Palomo recommends using ""the S technique"" when drying. Starting in the top left-hand corner of the window and moving the squeegee down in a motion that resembles the letter ""S"".

He says the trick is ""to always have it in contact with the glass"".

What do professional window cleaners use in their water?

Ms Morris says she avoids using brand-name cleaning sprays and in her experience, a little dishwashing liquid — ""usually whatever's on special"" — is enough to do the job effectively.

Cleaning your air conditioner in summer Photo shows A person holds up twom air conditioner filters. One is clean and the other is covered in dust. Cleaning your air conditioner's filters is a simple yet often overlooked task. And it is an important one that can not only improve your general wellbeing, but also save you money on energy costs.

Mr Palomo also relies on a splash of ""regular dishwashing liquid"".

If you live somewhere particularly hot and humid, avoid using water that's too cold on your windows, and likewise, don't use water that's too hot during cold weather.

""Windows are susceptible to cracking under pressure from water that's too hot or too cold, especially windows where you might get that odd stone chip from mowing lawns,"" Ms Morris says. She recommends using lukewarm water.

What shouldn't you use on your windows?

Products that are not specifically designed for cleaning windows can leave them smudged and make it more difficult to get a streak-free finish.

""When I'm going into properties and cleaning windows, there's often quite a lot of residue from products that are unsuitable for using on windows, and they're not cleaned off properly,"" Ms Morris says.

And although vinegar is often recommended as an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative to window-cleaning sprays, Ms Morris advises against it.

""Vinegar attracts flies, which is not what you want for your windows,"" she says.

Cleaning your fly screens and doors

Insect screens and doors generally do a good job of what they are supposed to — keeping flies, mozzies and other unwanted creatures out, while letting fresh air and breezes in. But those breezes can also carry dust and other particles, which can leave your screens dirty.

Microfibre cloths are useful for cleaning fly screens and doors. (ABC Lifestyle: Jo Joyce)

Modern screen doors and fly screens are often made from a steel weave to provide better home security and counter fire risk, or are a fibreglass mesh.

Max Kincade, who works for a Melbourne/Naarm-based company that sells security doors and mesh screens, says a soft brush from a dustpan set can be used to remove any surface dust, grime, and spider webs, but says ""a microfibre cloth or mitt"" soaked in warm, soapy water is ideal.

What if your screens need a more intensive clean?

Sometimes, screens will be on the inside of windows and doors. Kate Croukamp owns a cleaning company based on the Gold Coast, in the traditional Yugambeh language region, and says these types of screens can generally be lifted out and taken outside for a more thorough clean.

She says a small pressure cleaner is ideal, but you should make sure the pressure isn't so powerful that it will damage the screens. If you don't have a pressure cleaner, a hose will do the job, and if hosing from the outside isn't possible, she suggests dipping a broom in warm, soapy water and running that broom over the entire screen"".

If you do remove all your screens, make sure you label which screens belong where to make it easier to get them back in the right place.

Some riveted-in screens need special tools to remove them. Ms Croukamp recommends leaving these in place and sticking to a microfibre cloth.

"Why 'everything feels easier' for Chloe Rykers since her breast reduction When Chloe Rykers shared that she was going to have a breast reduction at 23 years old, she was surprised by some responses.

""Lots of people said, 'do you think men will still find you attractive?' There was a lot of comments around 'will you still look feminine?'""

""[Or] people said that you should wait until post children because they're only going to grow back and don't waste your money beforehand.""

Having the surgery was something she had thought about and questioned for a long time. But she says it was ultimately about ""the quality of life"" she wanted.

Chloe, who lives and works on the Gold Coast/Yugambeh language region, ""fell in love with health and fitness"" and became a personal trainer two years ago.

She says her ""big boobs"" have, in various ways, made her career harder and left her feeling uncomfortable and in pain.

Chloe had surgery in February reducing her breast size from an F cup to about a C or D, and spoke with us about her decision and the impact it has had.

These are her words.

'Something I always wanted'

A breast reduction was something I've wanted from probably about the age of 15.

I didn't do a lot of sport or gym or anything like that growing up because I was quite self-conscious and it sort of held me back. I had really big breasts.

As an 18-year-old I was working in the beauty industry. It meant I was hunched forward for long hours doing eyelashes, eyebrows and stuff like that.

It caused me a lot of back pain and I had a doctor, and a chiropractor give me a referral to a surgical clinic.

I started that journey, but I didn't really keep going through with it because it was such a big fee. It wasn't something I was able to pay.

But last year [when I was training for a marathon] it started to really upset me. Being so active was causing me a lot of pain. It took a big toll on my confidence.

I followed a girl on social media who had a [breast reduction] and I got to watch what she went through step by step to have the procedure done.

She was also young, and it gave me a lot of validation. She was someone I reached out to to talk about her breast reduction.

That's how I got into pursuing the surgery and why I decided to share it [on social media] myself.

I needed to find [someone sharing their journey] to understand the process. If I could do that for somebody else, then that was really cool.

Chloe Rykers says she felt uncomfortable in her clothing before surgery. (Supplied: Chloe Rykers )

'I questioned whether I was doing the right thing'

I got a recommendation for a surgeon from somebody on a Facebook support group I joined. I had to go to the doctor to get a referral beforehand.

Using super to pay for IVF Photo shows Cyndi holding her son upside-down in front of a purple mural Australians are increasingly accessing their superannuation early to fund IVF treatment. The involvement of fertility clinics has some experts concerned.

Social media was also how I found out some people paid through superannuation, and I realised that it was something that I was probably eligible for.

With referrals from my GP and surgeon I had to apply through the ATO [Australian Taxation Office] to have my super released on compassionate grounds for medical purposes.

It came to about $15,000 altogether.

There were lots of times when I questioned whether I was doing the right thing, mostly from a financial point of view, because I'm so young I don't have massive super savings. I don't have a massive savings behind me. I knew it was a very big dent to take out.

'There were lots of things I couldn't do'

I had the surgery in February.

For the first two weeks afterwards, I pretty much stayed in bed and didn't really do anything. [I was] on a lot of medication and painkillers.

I live with housemates, and had a friend at the time who wasn't working. He was able to help me with so many things … watch movies with me to keep me company, he was able to bring me food, take me to do a couple of grocery shops, cook and stuff like that.

I did do a lot of things by myself … but it was definitely important to have somebody or some sort of help because there were lots of things I couldn't do

I couldn't pick anything up or lift anything overhead at all for those first six weeks.

From there it was just very gradually going back to everything.

Chloe Rykers says she's now ""able to just go for a run without worrying about my chest and my back and more"". (Supplied Chloe Rykers)

'I have loved life since surgery'

I had wondered whether the recovery would be worth it because it's quite a big process, and whether I would be happy with the result.

It's been worth it for me. I would do it all over again. I possibly regret not doing it sooner.

Before surgery I always had to wear an extremely tight bra … which then made my stomach uncomfortable, made my back uncomfortable. It wasn't just my boobs. It was so many other parts of my body.

Just getting dressed to go for a walk is much less stressful and I'm not as uncomfortable in the gym. I'm able to do … things that my boobs didn't allow me to before.

All of my back, shoulder and neck pain has pretty much gone away.

"Does washing your fruit and veggies remove chemicals? Are you a religious fresh produce washer, or do you give your broccoli more of a cursory splash? Or maybe you don't bother at all.

Testing recently uncovered the presence of a banned chemical in fresh berries sold in New South Wales. High levels of another legal pesticide were also detected during this testing.

So, how effective is washing fruit and veggies at reducing the amount of chemical residues we generally consume?

Can pesticides be washed off fruits and veggies?

Julian Cox is an associate professor of food microbiology at the University of New South Wales and a member of the Food Safety Information Council board.

Dr Cox says washing fresh produce ""reduces risks in all sorts of ways"".

""Any washing will mitigate risk … and simply the physical act of washing will help move material from the surface, be it bugs, be it soil, be it chemical residues.""

Some produce is easier to wash than others, Dr Cox says.

""With something like raspberries — softer fruits — you really can't do too much with them in terms of physical action.""

He says this is why a lot of fruit and vegetables sold commercially are washed before sale using a food-grade cleaning solution with an ingredient such as chlorine.

Food and nutrition scientist Emma Beckett, based in Newcastle/Awabakal, says she cleans raspberries by dunking them into a mixture of vinegar and water.

She says it doesn't negatively impact the flavour at all.

Dr Beckett also advises washing your hands before washing your fresh produce.

""Otherwise, you're washing what's on your hand onto the thing you think you're washing.""

Banned pesticide shows up in NSW blueberries Photo shows A small hand holding a handful of blueberries A scientist investigating why pesticides were appearing in marine life discovers a banned chemical on NSW berries. The underwhelming response from the government has exposed regulatory blind spots in the system meant to protect consumers.

Jian Zhao is also an associate professor at the University of New South Wales, whose research areas fall within food science and technology.

He says washing fresh produce does reduce your risk of chemical intake, particularly with the help of baking soda.

Dr Zhao says this is because baking soda is an ""alkaline substance"" that will ""accelerate the breakdown of certain types of chemical residue"".

If the produce is smooth-skinned, he says running water with some rubbing is probably enough, but for harder-to-clean produce, he recommends soaking them in water with some salt or baking soda for about 10 minutes.

How is pesticide use controlled in Australia?

A spokesperson from Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) — which sets out the legal requirements for food produced and sold in Australia — says it ""undertakes periodic safety checks for chemicals of public health concern"".

The spokesperson says the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) registers and approves chemical uses and sets maximum residue limits (MRLs).

Authority considers restricting pesticide on berries Photo shows a closeup of blueberries Australians are eating so many berries that regulators are considering restricting the use of a widely used pesticide.

The spokesperson says these are ""set well below the level that could pose health and safety risks to consumers"".

The ABC's Background Briefing found residue testing happens every 4–6 years nationally, and it's largely focused on exports.

Last month, the APVMA announced a review into the use of dimethoate on blueberries, raspberries and blackberries as ""new information"" revealed Australians were eating ""significantly more berries"" than when it had last reviewed the use of dimethoate in 2017.

Do pesticides get absorbed into fruit and veggies?

Dr Zhao says, ""fruit and vegetables do absorb a small amount of pesticides, which is considered as part of the [MRLs]"".

Emma Beckett says organic produce is also an option if you're concerned about pesticides, but is 'more expensive'. (Supplied: Emma Beckett)

Dr Beckett says that ""some pesticides are incorporated into the structures of the plants, and others sit on the outside of the plant as a barrier"".

This impacts the usage limits and rules around when this product can be used in relation to when it is harvested (the withholding period), she explains.

How to get the fibre you need Photo shows Smiling girl with glasses eating apple and looking at laptop. People share a lot of their lives on social media. This can even include digestion details, with content about ""staying regular"", bloating and fibre far from off-limits.

According to FSANZ, ""Where a chemical specifies a withholding period or pre-harvest time between application and harvest, these directions must be followed. In this way, any residues left on the produce should meet the MRL requirements.""

Dr Beckett says if concern about chemical residue ""became a reason for people to eat fewer fruits and vegetables, that would be really sad"" because we're already not getting enough of them.

"Denmark PM apologises to indigenous Greenlanders who faced forced contraception Denmark's prime minister has apologised to a generation of indigenous Greenlanders who were forcibly prescribed birth control.

The apology by Mette Frederiksen in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, hopes to close a traumatic chapter in Greenland's history.

At age 13, Katrine Petersen was fitted with a contraceptive device by Danish doctors without her consent.

She had become pregnant, and after doctors in the Greenlandic town of Maniitsoq terminated her pregnancy, they fitted her with an intra-uterine contraceptive device, commonly known as an IUD, or coil.

Now 52 and living in Denmark, Ms Petersen recalled being told she had been fitted with the device before leaving the hospital.

""Because of my age, I didn't know what to do,"" she said tearfully.

"" I kept it inside me and never talked about it. ""

Ms Petersen said her trauma led to ""anger, depression, and too much to drink,"" as she suppressed memories of her experiences and didn't speak about it with doctors.

Later in life, after she married, she was unable to have children.

Many of the girls were inserted with IUDs between the 1960s and mid-1970s. (Business Wire via AP)

'Only one real thing to say: Sorry'

On Wednesday, Ms Frederiksen, in an emotional address, apologised to the women like Ms Petersen who were given invasive contraception by the Danish health authorities against their will in cases dating back to the 1960s.

""Today, there is only one real thing to say: Sorry,"" Ms Frederiksen said.

""Sorry for the wrong that was done to you because you were Greenlanders.

""Sorry for what was taken from you, and for the pain it caused.""

Ms Frederiksen lamented on ""a chapter in our shared history that should never have been written"".

""On behalf of Denmark. Sorry,"" she said to polite applause.

Apology comes amid Trump influence

Last month, Denmark and Greenland already published apologies for their roles in the mistreatment of the women and girls just ahead of the publication of an independent investigation into the abuse.

The event comes at a difficult time with US President Donald Trump exploiting divisions between Denmark and Greenland as he seeks influence, even jurisdiction, over the territory.

Trump's 'Greenlandic son' says US threats are helping Photo shows A man wearing an American Badass t-shirt. Most Greenlanders are angered by the US president's threats to invade the territory, but some believe it could give them leverage in their fight for independence from Denmark.

Meanwhile, Denmark has sought to placate the independence movement in Greenland, but historical abuses committed by the former colonial power have tainted its efforts at a rapprochement.

Greenland, which remains part of the Danish realm, was a colony under Denmark's crown until 1953, when it became a province in the Scandinavian country.

In 1979, the island was granted home rule, and 30 years later, Greenland became a self-governing entity.

The forced contraception of Indigenous women and girls was part of centuries of Danish policies that dehumanised Greenlanders and their families.

The policies included the removal of young Inuit children from their parents to be given to Danish foster families for re-education and controversial parental competency tests that resulted in the forced separation of Greenlandic families.

Young Inuit girls were fitted with contraceptive devices without their consent

An independent investigation, published earlier this month, found Inuit victims, some 12 years old and younger, were either fitted with IUDs or given hormonal birth control injections.

They were not told details about the procedure, nor did they give their consent.

Some described traumatic experiences that left them with feelings of shame as well as physical side effects, from pain and bleeding to serious infections.

While the report covered the experiences of 354 women who spoke with investigators, Danish authorities say more than 4,000 women and girls — reportedly half the fertile women in Greenland at the time — received IUDs between the 1960s and mid-1970s.

It is not known how many of those cases lacked consent.

""Of course, I'm thinking about all the women who were treated like I was,"" said Ms Petersen, who had her IUD removed earlier this year, after not speaking about her experiences for more than 30 years.

""I feel with my fellow women from this episode of our life.""

The alleged purpose of the forced contraception was to limit population growth in Greenland by preventing pregnancies.

The population on the Arctic island was rapidly increasing at the time because of better living conditions and better health care.

Greenland took over its own health care programs in 1992.

"The public hospital patients who ended up paying abortion clinics for miscarriage care Women having miscarriages say they were denied surgical care at the public Mater Mothers’ Hospital in Brisbane because of its religious policies on abortion.

Two women have told ABC News they ended up going to an abortion clinic because the Catholic-run hospital, which receives some taxpayer funding, would not provide them with a surgical procedure when they were having what’s called a missed miscarriage.

The women were among nine people who contacted the ABC with concerns about Mater policies after a couple spoke about their distress over the health service’s ban on pregnancy terminations for medical reasons.

A missed miscarriage is the medical term for when a pregnancy stops developing in the early stages, but the body can take weeks to register it and expel the tissue.

Both women want the Mater to review its miscarriage care processes. (ABC News: Michael Lloyd)

A 33-year-old woman – who we’re calling Lauren* – said she was ""traumatised"" by her experience at the Mater Mothers’ Hospital in July 2024.

Lauren was eight weeks into her much-wanted pregnancy when an ultrasound showed the embryo was only measuring the size of a six-week-pregnancy and had a ""very slow heartbeat.""

One week later, a second ultrasound showed the embryo had not grown and no heartbeat could be detected.

""So I went to my GP and she told me that this was a missed miscarriage,"" Lauren said.

With a toddler at home and a busy nursing job, Lauren wanted to have a surgical procedure called a dilation and curettage (or D&C) to remove the failed pregnancy from her womb.

""I was still incredibly unwell with first trimester nausea, fatigue, dizziness and the watch and wait treatment [for a miscarriage to occur naturally] … I didn’t feel like I’d be able to manage,"" she said.

""I just wanted to have the whole ordeal be over and be able to move on with my life and also try again for another pregnancy as soon as we could.""

Lauren says she went to an abortion clinic for surgical miscarriage treatment because the Mater Mothers’ Hospital wouldn’t help her. (ABC News: Michael Lloyd)

President-elect of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG), Nisha Khot, said missed miscarriages “are fairly common” and diagnosed by ultrasound.

""[There are] two things that can happen: one that you don’t see a heartbeat – that would be fairly clear,"" Dr Khot said.

""The other situation is in which the pregnancy doesn’t grow as you would normally expect it to grow.""

Mater Mothers’ Hospital would not provide chosen care

After two scans showed her pregnancy was not progressing, Lauren went to the Pregnancy Assessment Centre (PAC) at the Mater Mothers' Hospital in South Brisbane – the public maternity facility she lives in the catchment for.

Promoted as ""Queensland’s first purpose built 24/7 pregnancy assessment centre"", the PAC is available to ""both private and public funded women"" who have concerns during pregnancy.

Lauren said the midwife she saw that Friday was ""very lovely and caring"", and gave her a brochure about miscarriage and small memorial items.

Both women were given a brochure about miscarriage by the hospital. (ABC News: Emma Pollard)

But Lauren said she was also told ""there is nothing we can offer you at this time"" and she should go home.

After a weekend at home struggling with nausea, Lauren went back to the Mater to request surgical management.

""They then conducted a third ultrasound which again showed the baby was measuring the exact same as all the other ultrasounds, the size of a six-week-old,"" Lauren said.

Lauren said while the Mater ultrasound ""couldn’t quantify a heart rate"", she was told it did detect ""a flicker of cardiac activity"".

""They informed me that because of that, they were unable to do any active management,"" she said.

Miscarriage treatment can involve the same medications and surgical procedures as those used in abortions.

On its website, the Catholic-run organisation says it ""values human life from conception"" so does not provide termination of pregnancy or contraceptive procedures at any of its facilities.

New national guidelines for miscarriage and early pregnancy loss Photo shows Knitted cream baby shoes. Women's health experts have welcomed new national guidelines for the treatment of miscarriage, recurrent miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy up to 14 weeks gestation.

""I felt as if the miscarriage itself wasn’t traumatising to me, but the management I got from the Mater is what made it traumatic,"" Lauren said.

Instead of being cared for at her local public hospital, Lauren ended up paying $750 to have a D&C for her missed miscarriage at a Brisbane abortion clinic run by MSI Australia.

""Stories like mine are something that you would think you would hear from women out of Texas or the southern states of America. People don’t realise this is happening right here in Brisbane,"" she said.

"" We're having our public health be dictated by a company's religious beliefs instead of doing what is the best practice for women's reproductive health. ""

Second woman denied care at Mater for two miscarriages

Lauren’s friend and fellow registered nurse – who we’re calling Claire* - said she had a similar experience at the Mater Mothers' Hospital during two miscarriages three years apart.

In mid-2022 she made it to the 10-week mark in her planned pregnancy when an ultrasound done at a radiology centre showed the pregnancy had not progressed beyond seven weeks.

Claire’s general practitioner referred her to the Mater Mother’s Hospital for surgical management of a missed miscarriage.

Claire was told the hospital was a 'religious facility' and couldn't provide her desired miscarriage care. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)

""I was suffering with symptoms of hyperemesis [severe sickness], nausea, vomiting, every day,"" Claire said.

""I didn’t want to wait any longer … it was affecting my whole life and obviously now I’m also very sad.""

She said the hospital did another ultrasound and staff told her it “looked different” to her previous scan, so she needed to go home and wait a week.

A week later Claire returned to the Mater.

Claire says she miscarriage care she received at the public Mater Mothers’ Hospital has compounded her anxiety about falling pregnant. (ABC News Mark Leonardi)

""It was like déjà vu. I have to undergo another transvaginal scan,"" she said.

""It’s not grown, there’s no heartbeat, no activity whatsoever.""

Claire was given a Mater brochure on miscarriage but was again told to go home and wait another week.

She said the midwives would not give her clear answers but, when pressed, a Mater doctor eventually told her:

""I’m so sorry but this is a religious facility … and at this point to offer you treatment it would still be considered a termination or an abortion.""

Abortion and contraception provider MSI Australia says it “regularly” provides surgical miscarriage management for Brisbane women who live in the Mater catchment. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)

The now-32-year-old said she left the hospital ""devastated"".

""I realised … there is no circumstance here in which they’re going to help me,"" she said.

"" I walked the roads around the Mater crying and on my phone desperately messaging some of my friends. ""

Claire’s friends found her an appointment for a D&C at an abortion clinic where she said a doctor did another scan and confirmed her pregnancy was not viable.

The procedure cost her almost $1,000.

In March this year Claire and her partner fell pregnant again, only to be disappointed when a scan at 10 weeks showed another missed miscarriage.

Hoping the Mater’s response would be different, she again went to the Pregnancy Assessment Centre wanting a D&C to remove the failed pregnancy.

""They didn’t even scan me this time,"" Claire said.

""They just brought me into that same room and a midwife said it’s too early to call it a miscarriage, we need to scan you next week, in one week’s time, and likely the following week as well.""

Lauren and her husband recently welcomed their second child after the early loss of a planned pregnancy last year. (ABC News: Michael Lloyd)

Claire said she started sobbing and left.

She contacted the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital to ask if it could provide her with surgical management of a missed miscarriage.

""But I was told that I’m not in their catchment so I can’t get help there,"" Claire said.

The nurse again turned to an abortion clinic, paying around $800 for miscarriage treatment.

ABC News has seen pregnancy ultrasound reports from both women.

The Mater did not agree to an interview.

In a statement a spokesperson said it ""offers all available care options"" to women who are diagnosed with a miscarriage.

""A woman's choice of care informs the care we provide,"" the statement said, contradicting the women's accounts.

"" Surgical management is an option available to women who are diagnosed with a miscarriage. ""

The health service said it ""regularly reviews and updates its early pregnancy loss policies and procedures"" to ensure it remains ""closely aligned"" to clinical guidelines.

Non-profit abortion and contraception provider MSI Australia said it ""regularly"" provided services and support for women who experienced pregnancy loss and miscarriage who were unable to access care in public, private and Catholic hospitals ""including those who live in the Mater Hospital catchment"".

""This can be due to a variety of factors including hospital/health service policy, capacity constraints, lack of suitably skilled clinicians, and/or conscientious objection,"" Managing Director Greg Johnson said in a statement.

Obstetrician says women should have a right to choose their miscarriage management

Melbourne-based obstetrician Dr Khot will begin her tenure as president of RANZCOG in October.

She said women who had a missed miscarriage could: choose to wait for the pregnancy to pass naturally, take medication to trigger the body to expel the pregnancy or opt for a surgical procedure to clear the womb.

RANZCOG president elect Dr Nisha Khot says women should be able to choose their miscarriage care. (Supplied)

She said some women choose surgical management to avoid the onset of bleeding and cramping during their daily lives.

""All three choices should be available to all women,"" Dr Khot said.

""I have not experienced women being declined surgical procedures at any hospital that I have worked at.""

The doctor said women who have a missed miscarriage ""should not be caught up in any abortion ban"" and ""it’s really important not to conflate the two at all"".

""It is not a situation where this is a pregnancy that is going to grow to be a normal foetus and a baby, it’s a pregnancy that has failed and so it is not in the same category as an abortion,"" Dr Khot said.

A spokesperson for Health Minister Tim Nicholls says he ""has confidence"" women can access miscarriage treatment. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)

In a statement a spokesperson for the health minister Tim Nicholls said:

""All Queensland Hospital and Health Services (HHSs) have pathways for accessing treatment for miscarriage services.""

Claire said having a baby is ""what I want more than anything"" but she is ""extremely nervous"" after having two unsuccessful pregnancies.

Lauren and her husband recently welcomed their second child – a sister for their son.

Both women want the Mater to review its miscarriage care processes and follow all ""best practice guidelines"" for women’s reproductive health.

""It’s just cruel, it’s cruel what they did to me and what they’re doing to many, many other women out there,"" Lauren said.

"Dementia-linked protein lower in people reporting vigorous exercise, study finds More Australians die of dementia than any other cause, according to a recent report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.

It is well known that physical activity is one way to reduce the risk of developing the disorder.

Now, a new study has found a link between exercise and a reduction in a protein in the blood, which is associated with dementia.

The recently published paper by the Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre at the University of Tasmania has also found that the more vigorous the exercise, the more brain health is protected.

""The finding is really significant because it shows for the first time how a blood-based biomarker, that's indicative of dementia risk, is associated with a really key and accessible modifiable risk factor,"" Dr Eddy Roccati, a senior research fellow at the centre said.

Eddy Roccati says the finding is ""really significant"". (ABC News: Owain Stia James)

Protein linked with brain inflammation reduced by exercise

The study tapped into a large and willing group of participants through the ISLAND research project in Tasmania.

Dementia is Australia's leading cause of death Photo shows A close-up shot of a hand resting on an elderly woman's hands. Advocates warn the number of people with the condition could exceed 1 million without government intervention.

The project aims to understand who is most likely to develop dementia and ways to reduce that risk.

Participants give a blood sample every two years and also complete surveys about their lifestyle.

Colleen Davidson is part of the study.

Ms Davidson is well aware that physical activity is one way to reduce her chances of developing dementia later in life.

""I'm working towards where I need to be, and I think that's positive — just taking one step at a time and trying to make those positive changes,"" she said.

For the first time, scientists have been able to look at what impact reported levels of physical activity have on levels of a protein in the blood called serum glial fibrillary acidic protein or GFAP.

Wicking Centre director, Professor James Vickers, said GFAP was linked with brain inflammation.

""So it's a good marker for general brain health,"" he said.

"" We've basically found the more physical activity you do, the lower levels of this GFAP protein we find in your blood, which is probably indicating that you're in a better state of brain health. ""

James Vickers says the protein GFAP is a ""good marker for general brain health"". (ABC News: Owain Stia James)

The reduction in the protein is even greater for participants who engage in more vigorous forms of exercise.

""Things like running or swimming, things that make you puff and pant,"" Dr Roccati said.

Genetics play a part

The association between vigorous exercise and a reduction in the GFAP protein was less strong in participants with the ApoE4 gene.

About 25 per cent of people carry one copy of ApoE4 and 2 to 3 per cent of people carry two copies.

ApoE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

What is the ApoE4 gene that Chris Hemsworth has? Photo shows Chris Hemsworth wearing a black wetsuit while swimming in water with snowy mountains in the background After two decades of acting, Chris Hemsworth revealed he will take a break from his career, after learning he has a much higher-than-average chance of developing Alzheimer's disease.

Although inheriting the gene does not mean a person will develop the disease.

Actor Chris Hemsworth discovered three years ago he had inherited the gene from both his parents.

Dr Roccati said even though the reduction in the protein was not as strong for people with the gene, physical exercise was still important.

""You shouldn't look at genes as determining your fate [you] should be like, 'I've got this gene and now I am going to look at the best risk factors for me to address so I can reduce my risk of dementia over time',"" he said.

The reduction in the protein is even greater for participants who engage in more vigorous forms of exercise, such as running. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)

Other ways to reduce risk

The new study adds to growing evidence that around 45 per cent of dementia cases could be prevented by addressing modifiable lifestyle and behavioural risk factors.

Addressing physical inactivity, a key midlife modifiable risk factor, could significantly reduce dementia cases.

By 2065, almost 1.1 million people are predicted to have dementia, a 2.5-fold increase, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report.

James Vickers says if biomarkers were measured as early as possible, people would be able to get a better idea of their dementia risk. (ABC News: Owain Stia James)

Professor Vickers said there were about 14 modifiable risk factors.

Social interaction, good sleep and reducing blood pressure are some of the ways to reduce dementia risk.

High cholesterol, hearing loss, obesity and smoking increase the likelihood of developing the disease.

Professor Vickers said having a greater understanding how modifiable risk factors influence blood biomarkers could help predict future brain health.","Dementia-linked protein lower in people reporting vigorous exercise, study finds",lifestyle,N/A,Abc,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-22/how-exercise-can-reduce-risk-of-developing-dementia/105783238,2025-09-22 00:00:00,"A new study from the University of Tasmania has found that engaging in vigorous exercise is linked to lower levels of a protein associated with dementia risk, suggesting that physical activity may protect brain health.

"Antinatalists say human suffering, and climate change, makes having children unethical. Are they right? Elon Musk believes the collapsing birth rate is humanity's biggest danger. But antinatalists argue having kids is little more than a procreational Ponzi scheme, and the risks are real. This is the case against babies.

Elon Musk has said the collapsing birth rate is civilisation's biggest danger ""by far"", and he has fathered 14 children in response (as far as we know).

Vladimir Putin recently reinstated the Stalin-era ""Mother Heroine"" award for women who have 10 children in less than 10 years.

And China has completely reversed its ""one-child"" policy and now implements an aggressive fertility agenda that involves claims of human rights violations.

Ideas and policies that seek to encourage baby-making are often referred to as ""pronatalist"". But over the past 20 years there's also been a parallel rise in an opposing viewpoint: antinatalism.

It is important that antinatalism is not conflated with the childfree movement and the rise in maternal ambivalence. Both of those are important, but they still (usually) focus on whether or not people want to have kids.

An antinatalist is asking something different: Regardless of what we want, should we?

A baby is an optional extra

In Australia, fertility rates peaked at 3.55 babies per woman in 1961 and have been declining steadily since. In 2023, the Total Fertility Rate globally was 2.25 babies per woman. And now in late-2025 it is possible we have already dipped below the global replacement level of 2.1 children per woman. In 2024 Australia hit an all-time low of 1.51.

It's the same story in most rich countries: People have their first child later in life, have fewer children in total, and the number of those who never have any at all continues to rise.

Women in sub-Saharan Africa give birth to more babies than anywhere else, averaging between 4.8 and 5.1 babies each. But in countries like South Korea and Serbia fertility rates are below 1.1.

When fertility rates fall, most countries are unlikely to see the number rise again.

In their 2024 book, What Are Children For?: On Ambivalence and Choice, co-authors Anastasia Berg and Rachel Wiseman considered the title question from many angles, citing paper after paper, study after study, complicating the simple answers presented elsewhere. The conclusion I was left with after reading the book was that anyone claiming a decline in fertility rates has one predominant cause is either lying, or misunderstands the evidence.

I asked Berg about what I believe I've witnessed over the past five years: An explosion in the conversation about whether or not to have kids and why it feels different this time.

Berg believes ""the role of children and family in human life has changed from a constitutive element of what it means to live a flourishing human life to an optional project"".

In other words, having children is just one of many things we might do with our lives. We used to lead, in Berg's words, ""essentially intergenerational"" lives. But now we weigh things up as individuals: risks, rewards, advantages, and costs.

A generational, cultural shift is underway

As Australia faces a cost-of-living crisis, a lack of affordable housing is often raised as an important reason many people ""cannot afford"" children. But it is also undeniable that a generational cultural shift has occurred.

People now feel they must meet certain milestones of adulthood and stability before having children. The result is delayed first births, and fewer children overall.

Similarly, people in Australia point to the high cost of early childhood education and care, and a lack of equal parental leave policies — both of which certainly suck — but in various Nordic countries where these policies are generous and more gender-equal, the fertility rate remains low.

Berg points out that ""financial concerns certainly loom large in people's minds"" when considering whether or not to have children. But she says when people look at historical trends they rarely point out the most decisive one: As material prosperity and the standard of living have increased birth rates have decreased across the board.

It's not that people are being dishonest when they cite financial concerns. It's just that it's more complicated, and cultural, than that.

""Often underlying what presents as an anxiety about finances is a deeper concern about reaching a high and murky standard of maturity and accomplishment,"" Berg says, citing achievement in a career or bank balance but also personally and romantically. These achievements become ""a precondition to even so much as thinking about the question of children"".

Are you a 'philanthrope' or a 'misanthrope'?

Antinatalism — like any ""ism"" — is an umbrella term for a range of beliefs and attitudes. Underneath the big antinatalism umbrella are two predominant approaches: the ""philanthropic"" and the ""misanthropic"". Both hope to reduce suffering in the world.

The philanthropic antinatalist believes every human life involves suffering. From this belief they conclude it is therefore unethical to impose consciousness onto a new human who can't consent to that inevitable suffering. The solution to this problem, according to the philanthropic antinatalist view, is if a person does not exist in the first place. Only then can they be guaranteed to never suffer.

Importantly, the philanthropic position is not about some overall weighing-up of happiness versus pain. The philanthropic antinatalist is not arguing that we can tally good days of joy versus bad days of suffering. And they are not arguing that people whose lives involve more suffering somehow have less valuable lives. Instead, they are saying that suffering, to some degree, is an inherent and immutable part of each of our lives.

Sure, a person who wants to become a parent may believe that the odds are in their favour and that their child will experience enough joy in life to overcome the suffering, but there's no way to check with someone that they'd take that bet. You may personally feel that the good in your life outweighs the bad — and that's wonderful — but it doesn't make it true for others. Your experience also doesn't negate the suffering others live with.

By contrast, the philanthropic antinatalist believes there is no harm done if someone simply never comes into existence in the first place.

Is facing our suffering really where the meaning of life is found?

Many philosophers and philosophies have delved into the nature of suffering. In Buddhism, the First Noble Truth is that suffering exists. The Buddha taught that suffering can be overcome by abandoning cravings and attachments. German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer built on that in the early 1800s, believing that human needs, cravings, and urges brought about an inevitable and terrible suffering that could only be alleviated in certain engrossed states of temporary liberation. Danish existential philosopher Soren Kierkegaard and Germany's Friedrich Nietzsche wrote about suffering usually catalysing life lessons and being the necessary pathway to personal development.

Nietzsche might have said ""To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.""

But a philanthropic antinatalist's inquiries happen a step earlier: why force someone into that suffering at all, they ask?

By contrast, the misanthropic antinatalist is concerned with the suffering humans cause to each other, to animals, and to the planet. It is absolutely true to say that life is precious. But the misanthropic antinatalist argues that it is not only human life that is precious, and human beings, amongst all other animals on the planet, have uniquely devastating impacts.

As you can probably intuit, misanthropes are not usually fun to spend time with.

If you want to grab a burger they might remind you of the extremely confronting Australian animal kill clock that counts down the numbers of animals killed for food each year. If you want to go shopping, they may point out that each one of us now has about five bottle caps worth of microplastics in our brains. And if you try to suggest that most people are, at the end of the day, fundamentally good, they might counter that with the fact that the average Australian is wealthy enough to be in the global 1 per cent and yet The World Bank recently announced the world has almost certainly lost its goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.

On the Antinatalist Advocacy website they promote the divergence of opinions within their community.

""Speaking of not agreeing… There is a lot of intellectual diversity within our small but growing community. We've got antinatalists who are opposed to human extinction — at least for the time being — and we've got antinatalists who believe that extinction should be the primary (and obvious) end goal. We've got VHEMT (Voluntary Human Extinction Movement) supporters who think nature should be allowed to flourish, and those concerned with wild animal suffering who believe the exact opposite.""

As I said — it's a big umbrella.

The most famous living antinatalist is David Benatar. He is an emeritus professor in the philosophy department at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, and his first major work on antinatalism, Better Never to Have Been, was published almost 20 years ago.

Since then, he tells me, antinatalism has ""certainly been gaining increased attention"". Where Benatar's book was the first to break through to a non-academic audience, the topic is now regularly debated in the media and a string of publications have been published on the subject.

Kids and the climate change link

As I was reading about the different branches of antinatalism, it struck me that the climate emergency represents a convergence of the philanthropic and misanthropic camps. There is guaranteed to be more human suffering as the planet continues to heat. And with the evidence we now have about human impact on the planet, it's hard to care about how the climate is changing and not veer into misanthropy.

Earth's 10 hottest years on record are the last 10. As Benatar told me, ""There is now an active antinatalist movement, which has also been boosted by the environmental crisis.""

In 2021 protesters set fire to a pram outside Parliament House to object to then-prime minister Scott Morrison's inaction on climate change. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had just released a report saying that it was a ""code red for humanity"".

That report was prepared by 234 scientists from 66 different countries and highlighted that human influence had ""warmed the climate at a rate that is unprecedented in at least the last 2,000 years"". Those scientists pointed to stronger-than-ever evidence that human influence is responsible for changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones.

That's a lot of suffering.

That was the same year market research firm IPSOS published its Perils of Perception report into climate change, which looked at how people understood the environmental ramifications of their actions. (A 2024 report focusing on facts vs fiction has since been released.)

The 2021 report found that when asked to nominate what three actions were most likely to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of an individual living in a wealthy country, most chose recycling as much as possible (59 per cent), renewable energy (49 per cent) and using an electric or hybrid vehicle (41 per cent).

The problem was that while all of those are good things to do, the report claimed ""none are in fact in the top three most effective measures"".

So what were the top three?

The most effective way to reduce carbon emissions was to have one fewer child, followed by not having a car at all. And thirdly, avoiding one long distance flight.

Only 11 per cent of 21,011 adults who took part in the study correctly picked ""having one fewer child"" as the best thing they could do to reduce emissions.

On the other hand, while ecologists first raised the concept of an ""ecological footprint"" in the early 1990s, the idea of an ""individual carbon footprint"" was cooked up by oil giant BP in an American ad campaign in 2004 that was designed to place blame for the environmental impact on consumers, not corporations.

When I booked a flight, Qantas charged me around $20 to ""offset"" the footprint of my seat, even though the company made $21.9 billion in revenue last financial year.

A lack of regulation allows corporations and shareholders to keep giant financial profits and ""externalise"" the cost of their impact on the planet.

A new kind of mother guilt

Many people are annoyed by the idea that their most personal decision — whether or not to become a parent — is influenced by guilt for a scale of harm-for-profit no individual human brain can conceptualise. Fair enough.

The difficulty with that argument is the ongoing lack of accountability. Millennials blame boomers for the heat of the planet they inherited, but millennials have been adults for about two decades now, and have proven they're either unwilling or unable to make the fundamental changes to personal or corporate accountability required to make a real difference.

In fact, Australian Zoomers like climate activist Anjali Sharma are begging their elders to acknowledge that the government owes them a duty of care not to exacerbate the climate emergency. Sharma and a team of advocates worked with independent senator David Pocock to propose a duty of care amendment to the Climate Change Act in 2023. It would have applied to projects releasing more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon emissions over their lifetime. The proposal was rejected by a Senate inquiry. In 2021 Sharma and seven other teenagers tried to sue the government, arguing it had a legal duty not to cause harm to young people by exacerbating climate change when approving coal mining projects. The government fought them and won.

In the face of a lack of policy action young people are taking control in other ways.

Is it any wonder that young people are increasingly citing ""climate concerns"" as a reason not to have children of their own?

In 2021 The Lancet published the results of a global survey asking 10,000 children and young people from 10 countries, aged 16-to-25, about their thoughts and feelings on the subject. And 39 per cent said uncertainty around climate policy made them hesitant to have children. They reported a great sense of ""betrayal and abandonment by governments and adults"".

A reply I see often in the comments section on antinatalism articles is that older generations had similar anxieties around nuclear war. Was it the right thing to do, to create new life, under that looming threat?

There are a few key differences, though.

A missile is either a) deployed, or b) not deployed. And that choice is made by a small number of people. Aside from protesting, there's not much a single citizen could have done then, or now, to prevent nuclear war.

By contrast, the climate emergency is already here. It's happening. It seems to keep getting worse, and we're all implicated.

'I want to stop you becoming parents'

When David Benatar, the antinatalist, visited Sydney last year for the Festival of Dangerous Ideas he opened his presentation having to correct a somewhat misleading headline written about him in the Sydney Morning Herald. The article opened with the sentence ""David Benatar wants to stop you from becoming a parent"".

As he clarified to the chuckling audience of men and women, he did not want to stop anyone from doing anything. He did not want to control anyone. He wanted to convince. He said ""I don't want to stop you from becoming a parent, I want you to stop becoming parents.""

This type of ""mythbusting"" is familiar to many antinatalists.

People who have never encountered antinatalist ideas often conflate them with things like eugenics and eco-fascism.

But as Benatar told me, eugenics seeks to ""improve"" the human species (according to often racist criteria), sometimes through selective breeding. Eco-fascists, on the other hand, seek to exert control over others to advance environmental goals.

Antinatalism is neither.

Benatar told me his published works explicitly argue in favour of reproductive freedom, even though he believes procreation to be morally wrong.

""That is about as far from fascism as you can get,"" he argues.

No contemporary antinatalist I've ever read or spoken to wants to see their beliefs imposed on others through public policy. By contrast, many governments trial various types of ""pronatalist"" policies. There are economic arguments for having children, and as any treasurer will tell you, the threat of an ageing population looms. But these still prioritise the interests of the already living.

Benatar describes it as a ""procreational Ponzi scheme"". He says new people are just created to protect existing people.

""As with all Ponzi schemes, this one will eventually go bust, because the human species will eventually come to an end. One is only delaying the problem, not preventing it by employing pronatalist policies,"" he believes.

Antinatalism is on the rise. ( )

An ecosystem that causes harm

In responding to the misanthropic antinatalist argument, What Are Children For? author Anastasia Berg acknowledges ""it's impossible to overlook the extremity and frequency of human moral failure — our callousness and cruelty,"" but that outweighing that is her belief that ""we are, at every moment, free to choose to do the right thing. And I think each of us who have faced the possibility of doing the right thing — which is to say, all of us — know that to be the case.""

What keeps me up at night, though, is that the cobalt in my smartphone was probably mined by children in ""slave-like conditions"" in the Democratic Republic of Congo. And even if I do what the IPSOS report tells me and never own a car, as an Australian thousands of my individual tax dollars each year go to fossil fuel subsidies. Even if I don't proactively choose to do ""bad things"", being alive in a globalised world means I'm a part of an ecosystem that causes harm.

As the antinatalist argument goes, there are plenty of people alive right now who need care and resources.

The Antinatalist Advocacy website, co-founded by Australian antinatalists Lawrence Anton and John Williams, offers Five Steps to Doing Good that include reducing harm to animals and the planet by going vegan, and choosing an altruistic profession. The site compares the maths of the cost of raising one child to the same money saving at least 50 lives through donations to effective malarial treatment charities.

On the climate emergency point, at least, Berg points to the book After the Spike by Dean Spears and Mike Geruso, two leading economists from the University of Texas at Austin. Spears and Geruso ran the numbers and point out that, while it's true that if the human population halved itself tomorrow there would be fewer emissions, fertility effects on population size are far too slow to make a dent in carbon emissions in time for it to make a real difference.

""This helps us see a very clear way out of the predicament you outline, at least when it comes to our reproductive choices,"" Berg says. ""Only climate action will have the necessary effect on emissions and warming, and therefore that's what must be our priority.""

Berg and her co-author cited a Pew Research Centre study from 2021 that appears to challenge the idea that young people are really making reproductive choices based on the climate emergency. The study, which surveyed 3866 Americans aged 18-to-49, found 44 per cent of those without children believed it was ""not too likely"" or ""not at all likely"" that they would eventually have children. The figure was up from 37 per cent in 2018.

Yet only 5 per cent of the 2021 respondents cited climate change and the environment as a reason for not wanting children. The top concern was ""medical reasons"" followed by ""financial reasons"" and ""no partner"".

Berg and her co-author used these results to argue that although concerns for the planet dominate the public conversation, they aren't really impacting people's individual reproductive choices. Women in particular are punished for expressing ambivalence towards babies and parenting. However a young person can cite the climate emergency, as both a genuine concern and a bit of a smokescreen for a broader sense of ambivalence about their futures.

That American data runs counter to a 2019 Australian study conducted by the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) that surveyed more than 6,500 women of which one third of those under 30 said they were reconsidering having children or reconsidering more children ""because I am increasingly worried that if I have children they will face an unsafe future from climate change"".

The respondents to the Australian survey were emailed by the ACF so there is likely some self-selection bias in the results, but one third is still a significant percentage.

This is what I mean when I talk about the climate emergency representing a combination of the philanthropic and misanthropic camps of antinatalism: young people are worried their potential future children will suffer, and they don't have a lot of faith that humanity can turn this warming ship around.

Where is the love?

One thing I noted after attending Benatar's speech in Sydney was that he didn't once refer to love. In conversations I have had with others about whether or not they think they could, or should, be parents, almost all of them refer in some way to love.

I asked Benatar how his philosophy accounts for love?

""It makes eminent sense to love a child who already exists, but no sense at all to think that procreation itself is an act of love towards the child,"" he replied.

He argues that those who do not exist have no interest in existing.

""One does them no favours in creating them. Once they do exist, however, they then require love,"" he says. ""I don't deny that creating children can be good for those who thereby become parents. However, that does not change the fact that creating children is bad for the child who is created, because they can and will suffer and then die. I cannot see how that can be morally justified by the benefits this child's existence brings to the parents.""

Grim.

One of the most important things a good thinker can do is question their own presumptions. And when it comes to this ultimate question Benatar raises a critical point: Is your decision fundamentally self-interested?

It's true that many people, once alive, are glad to have been born despite their lives being a mixture of joy and pain. But that is not the case for everyone. If you do decide to create another person you are making a huge unilateral decision, with the risk that the subsequent life won't feel the same way you do. Should you check in first with the person you're about to create? You can't.

Berg, on the other hand, doesn't find this kind of argument particularly convincing.

""What we are responsible for as parents is not the sum of our children's wellbeing but preparing our children to meet's life's challenges, disappointments, and temptations as best we can,"" she says.

Both Berg and her co-author are now parents themselves. Benatar is not.

It's a question that I keep returning to as I find more websites and books considering pronatalist and antinatalist arguments: are these people just deciding what they want, then mounting an intellectually moral position to defend their desires?

Surely that would be the most cynical conclusion of all: that we are mere animals beyond the reach of persuasion or philosophy.

"Women band together to create community for rural mums feeling lonely For Tracey Angwin and her husband Steven, raising 23 children on their farm in rural Western Australia remains one of their happiest achievements.

The couple met on a cruise ship 40 years ago and tied the knot 12 weeks later, after Ms Angwin moved from Queensland to her husband's farm near Tincurrin, 250 kilometres south of Perth.

""I knew nobody when I came here, didn't even know what farming was,"" she said.

"" It was a bit of a shock, [we're] 63 kilometres out of town. ""

But she soon fell in love with the land, and was eager to grow their family and build a life on the farm.

Raising a family on a farm can come with significant positives and challenges. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)

When Ms Angwin was pregnant with the couple's third child, an advertisement in the local paper about a need for more foster carers caught her eye.

""My parents always had fosters and adopted kids in our house, so our house just rattled with people,"" she said.

""[And with Steven] being adopted, he felt we should be giving something back.

""We've got lots of love to give, so we thought, 'Yeah, let's do it.'""

Life as a rural mum 'can be brutal'

Raising 23 children on an isolated property was not without its challenges.

With her family on the opposite side of the country, Ms Angwin grappled with loneliness, a common obstacle for many rural parents.

""There were lots of tough times with the isolation,"" she said.

According to national charity Motherland, which seeks to connect isolated mums in regional areas, 50 per cent of rural mothers cannot access a physical mother's group.

Tasmanian farmer Steph Trethewey started the charity six years ago, after her own battle with postnatal depression shone a light on the lack of support available.

Motherland recently hosted a fundraiser at Darkan in WA's Wheatbelt, at which Ms Angwin spoke.

The charity also hosts online mothers' groups, so that women from across the country can have a community no matter where they live.

""It's all about connection, celebration [and] talking about the tough stuff,"" Ms Trethewey said.

""Being a mum on the land can be brutal, but it's also beautiful.

"" It's about making women feel less alone and we do that through sharing our stories together. ""

Reducing stigma on farms

Motherland said 80 per cent of rural mothers had experienced postnatal depression or anxiety, yet less than half sought professional help due to stigma, shame and lack of access.

Denmark rural counsellor, cattle farmer and mother of two, Louise O'Neill, said farming families needed to be encouraged to put themselves first.

""Yes, work on the farm is important, but so is their wellbeing,"" she said.

""[We need] spaces where we can connect with men too and allow them just as much right to talk about their emotions.

""Then that will affect everyone, like the whole culture around farming and agriculture and family.""

Louise O'Neill lives on a cattle farm with her family in Denmark, nearly five hours south of Perth. (ABC South West WA: Madigan Landry)

Ms O'Neill, who also spoke at Motherland's Darkan event, said she hoped change was already underway.

""I think there is more talk on the mental load … farming is not just the business of being on a tractor, it's the business of how you handle and manage your family,"" she said.

"" The more we can talk about mental health and wellbeing and not be afraid of it, the better families are going to be, the better rural life is going to be, the better agriculture's going to be. ""

After raising 23 children on her farm, Ms Angwin said one of the best ways to handle the ""tough times"" was to simply ask for help.

""Find your community, always talk to people and you're not alone,"" she said.

"How skateboarding became a family affair for Townsville single dad Jay MacAskill Skylah MacAskill isn't your typical skateboarder.



For one thing, she's four years old – and, when she hits the park, she wears a dinosaur onesie or a tutu.

With her dad Jay and older sister Ava in-tow, the family has found a new way of connecting — as a ""skate family"".





Four-year-old Skylah prepares to drop in on a quarter pipe. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick) A long-time skater who had drifted away from the sport for the last eight years or so, Mr MacAskill dusted off his old board after a park was built near his daughter's daycare.

""I put Skylah on the board. She was scared at first, but once she rolled down the ramp she didn't want to stop,"" he said.

""Within a week I was buying her a proper skateboard. That's where it all began,"" he said.

Soon, his eldest daughter Ava swapped her scooter for a skateboard, and the family discovered Skate Mates – also known as Sk8 M8s. Now both girls are hooked — and so is their dad.

""Somehow I ended up with two skater girls I didn't [have to] push into it,"" he laughed.





Townsville's Sk8 M8s group meets every week. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick) ""It's definitely a great feeling skating together. We've got something in common, something to talk about ... it's a really good bonding experience.""

While Mr MacKaskill is known around Townsville for his signature backflips, the girls are getting the hang of dropping in.

A drop in is when a skater balances their board on the edge of a ramp using their back foot and then pushes their weight on the front of the board to roll down onto it.

Ava said her first time dropping in on a ramp was daunting but with a bit of support from her dad she now feels comfortable. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)

Daughter Ava said her first attempt at one was terrifying, but her dad helped her.

""I thought I was going to fall backwards, but Dad helped me and I didn't,"" she said.

""I love learning new tricks and big drop-ins.""

More than tricks





Leonie Johnson co-founded the Townsville skateboarding community Sk8 M8s which meets every week at different parks around the city. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick) In 2019, Leonie Johnson saw a need for more support for skaters in Townsville and co-founded a weekly meet up group called Sk8 M8s.

She said all too often, skaters were seen as loiterers or troublemakers, and skate parks were perceived as intimidating and off-limits.

""We formed Sk8 M8s as a way of creating a safe space for skateboarders of all abilities [and] all ages, so they can come down and try it out and give it a go with support,"" Ms Johnson said.



""Some of the skaters we got to know in the community said they wanted to have more of a social [element] in skateboarding, because they felt it had some negative connotations.""





Sk8 M8s co-founder Leonie Johnson said a strong and supportive Townsville skate community has developed in recent years. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick) Four years on, Tuesday night Sk8 M8s sessions draw in toddlers, teenagers and adults to the city's major skate parks.

Far from being banished, parents pull up camping chairs with a thermos to watch and cheer their kids on at the ramp.

""We're involving parents in some of that community aspect and we're starting our little ones younger,"" Ms Johnson said.

""I think it's really important ... we need parents to understand what the culture is like at a skate park, and not to be afraid of the skate park.""

She said a lot of the more experienced skateboarders had become mentors, which helped the community develop.





Townsville's Sk8 M8s group helps parents get involved with their kid's skateboarding progress. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick) ""More experienced skateboarders will step in in a really gentle way to give prompts to the younger and newer skaters,"" she said.

""It means they're learning exactly the way that skateboarding is always meant to be: it's grassroots and it's community and about learning from your peers.""

For Ms Johnson, the lessons taught at the park go beyond landing a trick. Sk8 M8s places a strong emphasis on etiquette; getting back up after a fall, waiting your turn, respecting others, and sharing space with BMX and scooter riders, and even the occasional roller skater.

""Practice brings progress, not perfection. Not even Olympic skaters rock a perfect line every time,"" she said.

""You get knocked down and you stand back up and you give it another go. It's really important with our everyday life and what happens outside of the skate park as well.""

Every week the MacAskill family joins other families at one of Townsville's skate parks for the Sk8 M8s meetup. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)

As Townsville's skate scene grows, Ms Johnson said the community she's helped foster is as rewarding as any medal or trophy.

""When our kids are at school, [parents] don't always get to see the kids achieving and learning ... whereas here they get to sit, to walk alongside them,"" she said.

""Seeing their own children start to really blossom and thrive … there's a real sense of pride and connection.""

A little push (with love)

Mr MacAskill said skateboarding was helping his daughters leave their comfort zones.

Skylah became hooked on skateboarding when she discovered the skate park around the corner from her home. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)

""They're going to be scared no matter what before they do a trick, so it's just about holding their hand and sort of pushing them,"" he said.



""Once they have had that little thrill they'll go back to it again and they'll start to pick it up.""

"Riverina family grapples with daughter's devastating childhood dementia diagnosis When Rachel Anderson and Elijah Marshall noticed their daughter Hannah struggling to remember things she had just done, they knew something was not right.

""There were things that she used to be able to do that she just didn't seem to be able to do anymore,"" Ms Anderson said.

""Then other people started noticing and saying there's something not quite right with Han.""

Just 10 years old at the time, Hannah Anderson-Marshall was eventually diagnosed with childhood dementia.

It was a devastating moment for the family from Leeton in the NSW Riverina.

There is currently no cure, and like other forms of dementia, it is a regressive disease that results in death.

""I was making her a dress [at the time of her diagnosis] and I'm suddenly thinking … 'Is this what we would bury or cremate Hannah in?'"" Ms Anderson said.

""I just couldn't do a thing without thinking about Hannah actually dying.""

Hannah's father has also struggled to grapple with the grim reality of her diagnosis.

""Every once in a while [you] just go, you're not going to do that or you're not going to see that, like being able to celebrate HSC with her … walking her down the aisle,"" Mr Marshall said.

A stark reality

According to the Childhood Dementia Initiative, one in 2,900 babies across the world are born with a condition that causes childhood dementia.

About 50 per cent die by the age of 10, and 70 per cent will die before they turn 18.

Hannah's form of childhood dementia is an extremely rare neurodegenerative disorder with brain atrophy.

It causes seizures, loss of cognitive and motor skills, and loss of brain cells and neural connections.

The Childhood Dementia Initiative aims to find treatments and cures, provide access to quality care for children with dementia and their families, and to make the disease a global health priority.

Childhood Dementia Initiative director and neuroscientist Peter Schofield said childhood dementia was difficult to diagnose because every case was different.

Peter Schofield is part of an initiative researching childhood dementia. (Supplied: Peter Schofield)

""In the childhood dementias there are a bunch of very rare genetic mutations that result in deficits in nerve cell function in the brain and that causes the dementia,"" he said.

""In general, they all cause some accumulation of a toxic product inside the nerve cells, and that's what kills them.""

Dr Schofield said although the disease was relatively rare, the parents of children with dementia had a ""one in four"" chance of seeing the disease develop in any subsequent children.

""[But] because disease onset ranges from generally two to 14 years, most couples have already had a second child before the first is diagnosed,"" he said.

Childhood Dementia Australia aims to increase research into the condition.

Education support is key

Hannah, now 12, attends Gralee School in Leeton, a school for students with special needs.

Her teacher, Lizette Taylor, recently won a Minister's Award for Excellence in Teaching for her work with children with dementia.

""It got to the point where we couldn't really teach [Hannah] new things in school because it wasn't fair … to have to expect her to remember things that were brand new,"" she said.

""We kind of had to go back over what she had learnt, but kind of extend on it.""

Lizette Taylor teaches Hannah Anderson-Marshall at Leeton's Gralee School. (ABC Riverina: Nicola Ceccato)

Ms Taylor said it was important to adapt her teaching to Hannah's daily needs, and using visual aids had been helpful.

""Creating something called a memory book [has helped] because it has photos in there as well as words that they can go back and read,"" she said.

""Hannah went on a term-long holiday in term two, and I thought it'd be really cool for her to document it using this app.

""When she came back, she was able to go through it again using photos.""

Hannah's family has a similar focus, and is determined to make the most of their time with her.

"Farmer asks partner to marry him with special canola crop Primary school teacher Steph Carter, 24, is the envy of the Blighty district in southern New South Wales after an elaborate proposal organised by Will Henderson.

Mr Henderson, 25, spent five months growing and tending a canola crop in the shape of the words ""will you marry me"".

When the crop bloomed yellow in early spring the couple boarded a small plane on September 6 for the proposal.

""It was really surprising, but it was really amazing that he put in all that effort,"" Ms Carter said.

""It was really special.

"" I thought that he would propose soon, but I wasn't expecting him to do it the way that he did. ""

Years of planning, months of work

After five years with Ms Carter, Mr Henderson said he was ready to take the next step.

He said he had the canola proposal in mind for some time and started planting in April.

""A lot of lot of hard work and hours went into it, and a few white lies with Steph,"" Mr Henderson said.

""She usually wanted to go on a crop tour and I had to say no, which she didn't like too much.

""[The letters are] 12 metres wide. I used the air seeder width and just drew it on the GPS screen.

""You can see the ""E"" and the start of a couple of letters struggled a bit … so I had to re-sow that by hand weeks later,"" he said.

Mr Henderson had another surprise in store for his new fiance — her family and friends were waiting for them when they got home.

""They all live like a couple of hours away, so that was pretty surprising to have all of them there as well, which made it extra special,"" Ms Carter said.

"Family comes first for Queensland newsreader Rob Brough after months off air Rob Brough has been a familiar and beloved figure in regional Queensland for more than three decades.

But the nightly 7News presenter, and his signature wink, have been noticeably absent from television screens for many months.

The 70-year-old has opened up to ABC Sunshine Coast about the personal family battle that has forced him to step away from his career to put family first.

Brough said it was an ""instant choice"" to leave work last year when his daughter's cancer diagnosis worsened.

""About four years ago our daughter Jess was diagnosed with breast cancer,"" he said.

""That was pretty confronting.

"" But she's a hell of a kid. My goodness, she's such a fighter. She's such a beautiful girl. ""

The former Family Feud presenter and father-of-three said the family was rocked again when Jess then developed a secondary cancer in her brain.

""We got to a tough stage where things weren't working and not a lot of options were available,"" he said.

""It was just an easy choice for me to leave work and spend as much time as I could around her and her family.""

Days spent caring for grandchildren

Brough said his days were now largely spent helping care for Jess' three children on the Sunshine Coast, who he delivers to and from school each day.

""Family is everything and we live together. That's a beautiful thing because bringing up your children and then being a part of your grandchildren's upbringing is as good as it gets,"" he said.

""If you're chasing the meaning of life, for me that's what it is.

The family has already experienced its fair share of heartache after the sudden death of Brough's three-year-old son Sam some 30 years ago.

It prompted Brough to embark on a 1,200-kilometre ride in Sam's honour in 2014 to raise money for the Children's Health Foundation and the Humpty Dumpty Foundation.

""What I learnt from losing Sam was that you never know what people are going through and we must be careful not to be too judgemental,"" Brough said when launching the ride.

""I can remember walking through the shops at Christmas the year we lost Sammy and watching people buying toys for their children and wanting to scream that I'd lost my little mate.

""I guess we pass people every day and we have no idea what's going on in their lives.""

Love of footy creates family memories

Outside of his family, rugby league is Brough's second greatest love.

He held back tears as he described having Jess work alongside him this year as he coached his granddaughter's under-11s Kawana Dolphins girls team.

""Jess was helping me out managing that team, but things got tough and she had to pull out of that role,"" he said.

"" But that was lovely, we had some moments there together where we're all at the game and my granddaughter was playing. ""

""Broughy"", as he's affectionately known, coached the Maroochydore Swans open women's team to a grand final win at the weekend.

His youngest son Tyson Brough is also a successful National Rugby League referee.

""When I finished playing I was commentating when I was working on radio, then on television with the ABC and [channel] Nine and doing State of Origin, and then coaching football for 25 years.

""It's been a massive part of our life.""

'Telling stories that mattered'

"How to determine if your kid is well enough for child care Work demands and a lack of village mean keeping a child at home from care every time they have a sniffle can be a dilemma for many parents.

And with sickness so easily spread in childcare settings, it's a decision caregivers are regularly faced with — especially in the first year or two.

""Parents have my sympathy on that, there are a lot of demands on time and it can be really hard to judge what is best to do, both for child in the context of all the other dynamics, and commitments a family has,"" says Cathryn Hester, Queensland chair at Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.

She says sometimes it seems like kids experience several illnesses ""all at once or in quick succession"".

Upper respiratory tract infections, along with vomiting and diarrhoea bugs, are what Dr Hester sees most commonly in her young patients.

""There are just a lot of kids running around, and they don't have the best hand hygiene or sneeze-covering practices. Also, they have a developing immune system,"" Dr Hester says.

So, what can help you determine if your child is fit for child care?

When a sick child can't attend child care

When determining exclusion periods for a child, Australian childcare centres follow guidelines from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), explains Nesha Hutchinson, vice president at the Australia Childcare Alliance.

The mental load of parenting while sick Photo shows Mother sleeping on a couch with her baby on her While Lauren's husband can retreat to the bedroom when sickness strikes, mum life doesn't stop for her.

In most cases, time away from child care will be based on symptoms.

""Although some infections can be spread before the person becomes sick, people are usually most infectious when they have symptoms,"" a NHMRC spokesperson says.

For example, for diarrhoea or vomiting, it's recommended a child is excluded from care ""until there has not been any diarrhoea or vomiting for at least 24 hours"".

""If the diarrhoea or vomiting are confirmed to be due to norovirus, exclude until there has not been any diarrhoea or vomiting for at least 48 hours.""

Respiratory symptoms such as cough, runny or blocked nose, and sore throat, are to be assessed based on severity and what other symptoms they're combined with.

The full guide and fact sheets are available on the NHMRC website.

The NHMRC spokesperson says people should also refer to their relevant state or territory health authority, as some exclusion requirements may vary.

In addition to the guidelines, centres have the option to adopt director discretion, says Ms Hutchinson.

""For example, at a centre I worked at we had a child who was immunocompromised, going through cancer treatment, and we explained to families up front that our exclusion guidelines were going to be much stricter.""

Is my child well enough to attend child care?

To determine whether their child should be excluded, a parent should check whether the symptoms or diagnosed sickness have an exclusion period listed in the childcare service's policy, the NHMRC spokesperson says.

""Parents should also inform the service of their child's symptoms when reporting their absence.""

Kids who have fevers, rashes, vomiting and diarrhoea, are weak, or not eating and drinking as much should ""never be sent to day care"", says Dr Hester.

"" That child needs to stay home and have a medical assessment. ""

She says while children often ""bounce back really well"" from viral infections, they can also get ""very sick very rapidly"" and are best cared for at home.

If parents have any doubts, Dr Hester says they should consult with their family GP.

""They know you and your family history — they also know what viruses and illnesses are circulating in the community.""

She says parents can book a consult via TeleHealth if they are finding it hard to physically get into a clinic.

""They can help give advice about whether they should be staying home or if it's something they can soldier on with.""

The critically acclaimed Mystery Road: Origin returns as Detective Jay Swan (Mark Coles Smith) and Mary (Tuuli Narkle) uncover dark secrets in a haunted timber town, where the past threatens to tear them apart.

Ms Hutchinson says she understands it can be tempting for parents to send their child and just ""see how they go"", but the impact can be far-reaching.

""Dosing them up [with pain relief] just masks the symptoms, and they've just infected however many other children and therefore other families will struggle too.

""And the child is miserable … they want to be home with a primary carer and just to get rest and that one-on-one attention, which you can't get in a childcare setting.""

Myths about illness and child care

Parents are given plenty of anecdotal advice when their kids are sick, and some of it can be misleading, says Dr Hester.

For example, if the mucus coming from their nose is clear, they are fine to attend child care. If it's green or yellow, they are not.

""As a doctor I am not even remotely interested in the colour of snot,"" Dr Hester says.

""Some kids can have perfectly clear snot and be very unwell, or even starting to develop serious conditions like whooping cough.""

Ms Hutchinson says she also hears parents talking about children becoming sick from running around in cold air.

""That's not the case.""

She says it's important parents remember childhood educators are not medical health professionals.

""They do not have the ability to determine if your child is sick or not, all they can do is respond to the symptoms in front of them and respond according to the guidelines.""

Dr Hester says the best thing parents can do is try to prevent illness in the first place by making sure children are up to date with their vaccinations.

""With flu especially — I am seeing so many little kids with Influenza A at the moment, which can be largely prevented with vaccinations.""",How to determine if your kid is well enough for child care,lifestyle,N/A,Abc,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-16/the-advice-around-sending-a-sick-kid-to-child-care/105734762,2025-09-16 00:00:00,"Parents often face tough decisions about whether to send their sick children to childcare, as illnesses can spread quickly in these settings. Experts advise that children exhibiting symptoms like fever, vomiting, or severe respiratory issues should stay home, and parents should consult guidelines from childcare services and health authorities to determine exclusion periods.

"From Formula 1 to creating the 'world's best' croissant, how baking saved Lune founder Kate Reid's life As she walked through the doors of one of the most famous bakeries in Paris, Kate Reid was overcome with excitement, hope, and a renewed sense of purpose.

It was 2010, and the young woman from Melbourne was still in the grips of the anorexia that had almost claimed her life.

""I don't know if many people could say they've had an overwhelming experience in a bakery, but that's exactly what it was,"" she says.

The quest to make the perfect croissant was key to Kate's recovery. (Supplied: Instagram/Kate Reid via photographer @chris.jpg)

It's fair to say not many people are like Kate Reid.

An aerospace engineer who had meticulously secured a job working for an international Formula 1 (F1) team by the age of 23, Kate's spiral into anorexia began when she realised that the reality of working in F1 didn't match the dream.

Feeling as if she had lost control of her life, Kate turned all of her determination and resolve towards the one thing she could control — her body.

""I've never had a period in my life where I haven't had something to obsess over,"" Kate tells Australian Story. ""For me to be inspired to get out of bed … I need something to latch all of my thoughts, intellect and focus on.""

Turning her controlling nature inward would have near-deadly consequences for Kate; her commitment to restricting food meant she became obsessed with the one thing she craved most.

Delicious, perfectly made French pastry.

""When you suffer from anorexia and you fall in love with baking, it's almost an oxymoron. I mean, the two don't go together,"" says her father, Bob Reid.

Yet for Kate, pastry — and in particular, the croissant — would ultimately rescue her from the illness that has the highest mortality rate of any mental health disorder.

A work placement at the famous Paris bakery Du Pain et des Idées enabled Kate to learn the basics of croissant production.

Returning home to Melbourne, she then began a fastidious process of reverse-engineering the croissant to perfection.

It would lead to opening Lune, now a business of seven croissanteries and home to what the New York Times suggested might be some of the best croissants in the world.

""The croissant to me is the Formula 1 of the pastry world,"" Kate says. ""It's incredibly technical, and I guess it's where I found the intersection of baking, art, science, and engineering. It healed me.""

Building bonds

The need for control started early for Kate.

At 18 months, she was diagnosed with chronic asthma and was admitted to hospital 13 times before she was four.

Severe asthma made childhood difficult for Kate. (Supplied: Kate Reid)

""The asthma was the earliest example of a huge element of my life being out of control,"" Kate says. ""So the things I could control probably became more important than maybe they should have been.""

Her parents, Bob and June, became her lifeline, June spending long days monitoring Kate's health while Bob took the night shift.

As a little girl, Kate would wake up alone in a panic, unable to draw a breath. Bob would come to her rescue, administering the nebuliser machine.

It would lead to a strong bond ""that otherwise might not have been there,"" Bob tells Australian Story.

Kate grew up idolising her dad and was keen to find any opportunity to spend more time with him. Cars were an easy in.

The F1 manifesto

Bob worked as an engineer but also loved car racing. On cold winter nights, he and Kate would stay up late and watch F1, the weekly ritual becoming a shared interest.

Then, in the space of a day, Bob's passion became Kate's obsession.

It was March 10, 1996. Bob had agreed to take Kate, 13, to the Australian Grand Prix, which was being held in Melbourne for the first time.

""It was just a blur and a noise and a vibration. I'd never felt such an intense pull to something,"" Kate says. ""It was that moment witnessing it in person that I was like, 'That's what I'm going to do.'""

With her life goal firmly in place, the determined teenager set about writing her ""Formula One Pledge"", mapping the path to her dream of becoming the first female technical director of an F1 team: graduate high school with top marks, complete a degree in aerospace engineering, and get a job working for British F1 team Williams by age 25.

She achieved it all two years ahead of the timeline.

""She was absolutely elated,"" Bob says. ""For a girl to get a job in the aero lab at Williams F1 was unheard of.""

Kate mapped out her F1 dream job as a teenager and set about making it a reality. (Supplied: Kate Reid)

The dream shattered, Kate spiralled

In 2006, Kate moved to the small English town of Wantage to begin her new life as a junior aerodynamicist at Williams.

Yet the excitement eventually began to dissipate. Where she had imagined a dynamic environment alongside inspiring minds, the role was static and lacking in any collaboration.

Talking was discouraged and the 16-hour days were long and lonely.

""I was simply just a monkey put in front of a computer to design parts that I had no input or influence in,"" she says.

Adding to the challenge was the fact that Kate was the only female working in a technical role in the team of 120 people. There wasn't even a female toilet.

This was her dream job, but it was leaving her depressed. She started having panic attacks, and her mental health began to decline.

Kate admits she was consumed by her need for control. (Supplied: Kate Reid)

Kate started to make decisions to pull control back into her life. She joined the gym and began obsessively recording her progress, weighing herself and measuring her food intake against calories burned.

""I needed an obsession and control to latch on to, to feel like there was a purpose for me existing,"" she says.

On a trip home to Melbourne for Christmas, Kate's parents were alarmed by the deterioration of their daughter.

""We actually could see she was spiralling out of control,"" June says.

Kate’s mother June says she did her best to support her daughter. (Supplied: Kate Reid)

But Kate's determination had turned dangerously inward, leading to an anorexia diagnosis.

""If I wasn't this groundbreaking female engineer working in Formula 1, then maybe it didn't matter if I didn't exist anymore,"" she says.

It was the middle of the night in May 2008 when Bob and June received a phone call from their distressed daughter, who had reached breaking point.

Bob asked if he should make the decision for her, and Kate finally conceded she needed to come home.

""If he hadn't have said those words to me, I'm not sure what the stop point would have been.""

After an emotional return to Melbourne, doctors warned that without treatment, Kate would have had just six weeks to live.

'Trapped in an anorexic prison'

Kate's love of baking started in her childhood when her mother would prepare treats for afternoon tea.

The pleasure she got from baking increased during her time at Williams, where she'd bring in brownies to perk up her F1 colleagues. It was a way for Kate to vicariously enjoy food without eating it.

On her first day back in Australia, she landed a job at a bakery.

""I always push myself to be in the most extreme environment. And with the eating disorder, it was surrounding myself with tempting baked goods and testing my willpower,"" Kate says.

If she ate even a morsel of a brownie during a shift, she would panic and punish herself with long walks at night.

Bob would drive the streets looking for his daughter.

""When you know your kid is sick and you can't fix it, it's really hard.""

All they could do was support Kate, enlisting the help of a team of medical professionals as they began what would become a five-year battle against the illness.

"" Kate was trapped in an anorexic prison,"" her brother Cameron says. ""And Mum and Dad were trapped in there with her. ""

Kate battled anorexia for five years. (Australian Story: Simon Winter)

Taking over the kitchen, she would insist on preparing all meals and baked cakes incessantly for her parents.

""From the moment I woke up, my entire existence was about avoiding food and controlling it,"" Kate says. ""I just became so insular and selfish.""

Desperately grasping for a new purpose to define her again, Kate even auditioned — unsuccessfully — for the first season of reality cooking show Masterchef.

Kate says she would ""test her willpower"" around food when she was in the grips of anorexia. (Australian Story: Sarah Grant)

And then she found the book that changed her life. Flicking through a coffee table book about Paris patisseries, she was struck by the image of a stack of pain au chocolat, taken at the famous Du Pain et des Idées bakery.

""It was the most hypnotising thing I'd ever seen,"" Kate remembers, explaining that the layers of buttery pastry instantly reminded her of the aerofoil sections that form around an F1 car.

She booked a flight to Paris that day.

Perfecting pastry with 'precision and control'

Convincing the owner of Du Pain to give her a work placement would revive the passion Kate had lost in her life — and mark the beginning of her recovery.

""That four weeks might be the most fulfilled I've ever been in a job,"" she says. ""It was a reminder of me before the eating disorder, when I was excited to get out of bed and feel like I was productive.""

Kate says her four-week work placement in Paris was pivotal to her recovery. (Supplied: Kate Reid)

Back in Melbourne, the fire was lit. Nobody was selling anything like the croissants available in Paris. She was going to create the perfect croissant, her way — ignoring the detractors who questioned the logic of opening a business that just sold one thing.

Unlike her time at Williams, where her failures were quickly discarded, Kate's test batches were shared with her family, who supported her new pursuit of perfection.

""All the things that are required in engineering are also applicable to pastry — precision and control,"" Bob says.

Kate approached pastry with an engineer's mindset: precision, technique and perfection. (Supplied: Kate Reid)

Leasing a small workspace, she embarked on months of recipe testing, obsessively recording and measuring the results.

Retaining the three-day process required to make a traditional croissant, she imported the butter from France to ensure the hero ingredient was the best it could be. The crust was crunchy with a delicate shatter, and the interior was beautifully buttery.

June witnessed her daughter slowly coming back to life as the dream took shape.

""When she actually perfected the croissant, that put the biggest smile on her face.""

How Kate learned to relinquish control

Lune Croissanterie opened as a wholesale bakery in 2012.

When her brother Cameron joined a year later to help convert the business into a retail operation, buzz was building.

""By 6.30am, there would be 120 people lined up around the block, and it was the dead of winter,"" Kate says.

In 2016, The New York Times named Lune croissants as some of the world's best, launching an avalanche that is yet to slow down.

What started as just seven batches a day has grown into seven stores in three states, run by 300 staff.

Earlier this year, Kate was awarded France's Order of Agricultural Merit for ""redefining"" the croissant, and will soon release her memoir, Destination Moon.

For the dream to grow, she had to relinquish some control — an exercise that has been crucial not only for her business, but for her recovery.

""We think we can have control of everything, but we can't,"" Kate says.

""Managing an eating disorder is a lifelong struggle, but I am aware of not dropping back into those behaviours, knowing that it gives me the comfort of control.

She wants her story to offer hope to others battling eating disorders, that a rewarding life on the other side is possible.

And she's redefined what success looks like: ""Maybe success is having the self-awareness to realise that you're actually living a great moment right now, and to appreciate it.""

"Pistachios are the latest food trend and a lot of work goes into predicting what's next It's a Tuesday winter morning in the Brisbane suburb of Yeerongpilly.

The bright green nut has found its way onto menus worldwide and is hyped as a must-try across social media.

So, how did pistachios suddenly rise in popularity? Will they just be replaced by the next fad in six months? And what is the next big thing?

They're the questions Andonis owner Anthony Kekkou constantly asks.

Pistachios may be popular now, but it's unlikely they'll be trendy forever. (ABC News: Liana Walker)

A trip to Dubai

Four years ago, halfway across the world, Sarah Hamouda was pregnant with her second child when an insatiable craving hit.

Fortunately, the Dubai-based mother is a food scientist.

""I was looking for something unique and fulfilling that I couldn't find in typical desserts,"" she tells Falstaff magazine.

Hamouda told the wine, food and travel publication, she wanted a chocolate bar with different textures and flavours that offered a satisfying and rich experience.

So was born the first Dubai Chocolate: a milk chocolate bar filled with pistachio-tahini cream and chopped filo-pastry kadayif.

Dubai chocolate has become a must-try item on social media. (Instagram: fixdessertchocolatier)

Hamouda's chocolate, titled ""Can't Get Knafeh of It"" is near impossible to get a hold of.

Its limited supply can only be purchased during a two-hour window via a delivery app, and despite its 68.25 Emirati Dirham ($28.13) price, the bar almost always sells.

About this time, Andonis owner Kekkou was travelling through Dubai, searching for the next big thing.

""I find a lot of people play safe and look locally for other trends that the neighbours are doing,"" he says.

""As opposed to us, while we're still on the global platform and we're looking for new ideas.""

Looking globally can help inspire food trends locally. (AP: Kamran Jebreili)

When a TikTok video of an influencer showing off the colourful chocolate's bright green insides went viral, Kekkou knew pistachios were it.

While social media can be a trend indicator, it's not the only gauge.

Art and science

Back in Australia, Amanda Spry lectures in marketing at Melbourne's RMIT University.

The rise of pistachios is high on the academic's radar.

""It's a bit of a mix of art and science, of culture and data,"" Spry explains.

""Experts would certainly be looking at things like global food innovation, flavour trend reports, retail sales data and cultural and consumer behaviour shift.

"" But I think with something like food and, especially, when that's very closely intertwined with social media, your social and aesthetic cues play a really big role here. ""

Generative AI, social media tags and search trends help guide marketers.

Globally, searches for pistachios began to rise in 2021 — the same time Dubai chocolate was created — and peaked again in late 2023.

Like fashion, food trends can be cyclical, seasonal, and follow both high-end and street style taste-makers.

Spry says social media connects what is in vogue to the masses.

""If you want to get onto a trend now … that doesn't have to necessarily be a pistachio dessert at the most high-end, premium restaurant in Melbourne, it could be a pistachio croissant at your local cafe,"" she says.

But by making pistachios so prominent in the market, it's started to make them harder to get.

Pistachio growth

Pistachio farmers around Australia are preparing for a large harvest this year.

The gentle sounds of water flowing down Wakool River hum in the background of Chris Joyce's Kyalite pistachio farm on the New South Wales side of the Murray River.

To the untrained eye, the bare orchard trees may look close to death, but it is going through a chill period; about 1,000 hours below 7 degrees in the winter months.

""You need very, very hot summers, very cold winters and access to water and little rain in particular in February, March during the harvest period,"" Joyce says.

Pistachios are sold in multiple forms. (Supplied)

This year Joyce is expecting a big harvest from the biennial bearing trees. And he will need it to keep up with demand.

Collectively, Australian pistachio growers are expecting to harvest 5,000 tonnes this year, just meeting Australia's expected consumption.

""Up until now, the total demand in Australia has been supplemented with imports,"" Joyce says.

"" Over the next two years, we would expect Australia to be supplying virtually all of Australia's domestic requirements, and we will also be exporting some as well. ""

Pistachios are sold in two forms: in shell or kernels.

Kernels have seen a massive spike in demand, increasing 40 per cent in the past six months, while shells remain steady, Joyce says.

He says it is clearly connected to the hype around the nut, as kernels are predominantly used by the food service industry for their aesthetic.

While there is sales growth in kernels, the volumes are not substantial, and the price of in-shell remains far more profitable for growers.

""Personally, I think Dubai chocolates are sort of like striped toothpaste — it's a fad,"" Joyce says.

"" Will this last seven years? I don't think so, but I'm a grower, not a marketer. ""

He's not the only one questioning the pistachio's staying power.

Fads or trends?

Back in Brisbane, it is food futurist Tony Hunter's job to answer that question.

Hunter works with some of the largest global brands, including KFC and Pepsico, to stay ahead of trends.

""We have to separate our fads and trends,"" Hunter says.

"" Fads are very short-term. They come and they go, but they can be part of longer-term trends. ""

Popular spices can be fads that emerge from the wider trend of more flavoursome food.

Likewise, pistachios are a fad that has emerged from the trend of indulgence — or little treat culture.

Some bakeries have embraced the pistachio trend. (ABC News: Liana Walker)

Knowing what the next thing is requires a lot of research, including reading industry newsletters on everything from ingredients to food technology, watching flavours transcend across food and drink and observing new businesses.

""If I see one thing that's, Oh, that's interesting. I see it twice, three times. Then I'm going, 'OK, this is now,'"" he says.

"" We don't know what we're looking for until we see it. ""

Hunter expects the next big thing will be a focus on fibre, feeding into the overall trend around wellness.

It's an example of a trend emerging out of something that is already trending.

Thursday afternoon in the Gold Coast's Robina shopping centre, Oliver Allis is surrounded by the chatter of friends catching up under a pumping stereo.

""We're busier than the pub,"" Allis jokes.

The brand director for Yo-Chi knows better than most about trend emergence; its main product, frozen yoghurt, is vulnerable to the trend cycle.

To extend Yo-Chi's longevity, Allis looks to capitalise on other trends that it can integrate into its business model — like pistachios — a strategy that has helped the brand become a taste maker.

A collaboration with Pistachio Papi spread was an obvious choice.

""We didn't know it was going to be as huge as it was,"" Allis says.

""Some people might say that Yo-Chi helped them get to that mass appeal by [doing] such a large marketing campaign.""

To maintain taste-maker status, Allis must be tapped into the next big thing.

""We try and pride ourselves on being very good listeners and observers and immersing ourselves in environments where creativity is happening or trends are brewing,"" Allis says.

Research is done on social media and in person. From seeing what tags are popular on TikTok to visiting a new dessert bar in a hip suburb and talking to people around them.

""You can't force these things. If you force it, that's when you don't get the gold or the right flavour or right topping, or right collaboration,"" Allis says.

Coming up, Allis says Yo-Chi is looking at ube, a bright purple Filipino sweet potato, yuzu — an East-Asian citrus fruit, Australian natives, and even edible cutlery.

When a trend dies

Like Allis, Kekkou works to stay ahead of the curve.

""We've always been on the lookout for global trends and we like to roll them out, introduce them first,"" Kekkou says.

Part of that is knowing when a trend has come to an end.

Hunter says there's no real time frame, but he suspects the pistachio fad will come to an end within the next 12 months.

""What we're finding now is there's a bit of a pistachio overload,"" Kekkou says.

""I think people are starting to get a little bit bored of it as well.

""So I think now is the time to start looking at the next trend or try to introduce the next trend.""

For Allis, there's one key indicator that a trend is done:",Pistachios are the latest food trend and a lot of work goes into predicting what's next,lifestyle,N/A,Abc,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-21/pistachios-are-everywhere-but-how-was-that-decided/105680106,2025-09-21 00:00:00,"The rise of pistachios as a food trend is attributed to their vibrant appearance and social media popularity, with cafes and restaurants globally incorporating them into their menus.

"Cashrewards's abrupt closure leaves shoppers many unanswered questions. Here's what we know Cashrewards — a loyalty program which once had 2.5 million Australians in its database — has left many shoppers stunned after its abrupt shutdown last week.

The cashback website pays back its members a percentage of the purchase price in cash after they shop in its partnered retailers.

Its closure has also left many questions:

How do these cashback companies operate and make profits?

Can consumers get their money back from their accounts?

Are there alternatives?

Should we be cautious about using cashback apps?

Let's find out.

Why did Cashrewards close down?

At this stage, we don't know.

Neither Cashrewards, nor ANZ Bank's venture capital fund 1835i, which owns the cashback app, have made any public statements.

According to the Australian Financial Review, Cashrewards was failing to meet ANZ's expectations, amid a wider review of the bank's performance and profitability by its new chief executive, Nuno Matos.

What to do with your funds?

Cashrewards has urged its members to withdraw their funds by October 24 and submit any transaction queries by October 10.

When asked what would happen to the money if it remained unclaimed, Cashrewards' CEO Anthony Seymour-Walsh tells the ABC that the company ""intends to repay all customer monies"".

Customers will have their available funds automatically transferred to the linked bank account if they miss the October deadline, according to Cashrewards' website.

All withdrawal claims must be received by December 12, it said.

How do cash back companies make money?

Cashback offers were essentially a form of discounting, said Andrew Brennan, a senior lecturer at Curtin University's Faculty of Business and Law.

""Gaining a large member base, and therefore generating more sales for the retail partners, is good for profitability,"" Dr Brennan told the ABC.

"" Cashback advertising schemes refer a shopper to the retailer and make a commission from the retailer every time a transaction is completed. ""

Using cashback apps wisely can help with the cost of living, but they also come with the possibility of overspending, according Dr Brennan.

""Everyone loves a discount, and it makes us feel good, with more money left over for other things to buy or we can put away for savings,"" he said.

Shoppers are warned that cashback apps are a double-edged sword. (AAP: Jane Dempster)

""If you buy products or items you would normally buy anyway, then a discount might be worthwhile to you.

""[However], you might buy something on impulse because it is advertised within the app as a 'limited time offer'.

"" You could end up spending more in total on goods you might not even need. ""

He added that exercising self-control was key.

Are there alternatives?

There are five cashback apps and sites to consider, including Cashrewards, which ranked as the top option, according to financial research agency Canstar.

Cashback apps reward users with free money – but at what cost? Photo shows Viona Agung is standing in front of a cafe, holding her smartphone up to capture a QR code displayed on the front counter. Viona is a cashback app user who has earned hundreds of dollars in cashback, but a consumer advocacy group is warning of privacy risks.

The agency's data insights director, Sally Tindall, said the sudden closure of Cashrewards left millions of shoppers scrambling to figure out what's next.

""For those with uncashed rewards, the immediate priority is to get your funds out by the October 24 deadline,"" she said.

""While it's a shame to see an Aussie-owned cashback pioneer disappear, there are other similar brands still kicking around, such as ShopBack and TopCashback.

""Just be sure to read the terms and conditions and make sure you're not spending more just because of the lure of money back.

"" Remember, what matters most is the price you pay, not how big the discount or cashback is. ""

What about privacy data?

To set up a cashback account, you need to first sign up as a member by providing your personal details, including your name, email address, and phone number.

As of September 8, Cashrewards had 2.5 million Australians signed up for its service.

Customers are advised to be mindful of what private data they share with cashback companies. (Getty Images: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto)

""[Cashrewards] customer data will be held encrypted in a secure state for regulatory purposes and destroyed safely at the conclusion of any statutory period,"" Mr Seymour-Walsh said.

""Members who request their data to be deleted will be actioned accordingly.""

Dr Brennan said that with free apps, customers need to be informed and comfortable with what kind of data was given away.

""Customers win by getting discounts with their viewing and buying habits recorded and tracked within the cashback app/website itself,"" he said.

"" But it is also a win for the retailers as they gain insights for marketing. ""

What can we learn from this as consumers?

""Clearly, these apps are popular amongst consumers due to the discounts they offer,"" Dr Brennan said.

""Competition is usually a good thing for consumers, in the form of lower prices, decent rewards and potentially a better service offering.

""There is one less competitor now, with Cashrewards no longer supported.",Cashrewards's abrupt closure leaves shoppers many unanswered questions.

"Home-buying dream of Australians pushed further away by RBA rate cuts, making life 'more difficult' While most Australians with a mortgage have been benefiting from the Reserve Bank cutting rates this year, not everyone is celebrating.

Savers are worse off because the rates banks offer on savings have been falling too.

Australians have $1.64 trillion saved in the bank, according to the latest APRA statistics, a record high. It's up by $35 billion in July alone.

Stuart De Poi and his wife Rianna have been saving up for their first home.

""Every pay cycle, it seems like our pay goes less and less far,"" he said.

Stuart De Poi has been saving for a home for two years. (ABC News: Matt Holmes)

""Since having our daughter, it's been more difficult to save the amount that we need to, which pushes the horizon of when we could buy a house further and further away.""

They have already been saving for two years to pull together a deposit and will receive some financial help from family. Without 'the bank of mum and dad' it could take them a decade just to save the deposit, perhaps longer if rates keep dropping.

The Reserve Bank started cutting interest rates in February this year, then followed up in May and August.

""At the start of the year, we were earning an interest rate of 5.5 per cent if we jumped through the hoops to meet the requirements to earn that interest rate and currently it's down to 4.8 per cent,"" said Mr De Poi.

Canstar's data insights director, Sally Tindall, says while many lenders were offering ongoing savings rates at around 5.5 per cent a few months ago, now there is just one.

""But there are plenty of catches that come with this account,"" she said.

""Firstly, you've got to meet the monthly terms and conditions. Secondly, you've got to be between 18 to 29 years of age.""

Sally Tindall says people with savings need to shop around to get the best interest rate. (ABC News: John Gunn)

There is a huge range of rates on offer, essentially from 0 per cent [base rate] up to 5 per cent.

""A competitive rate at this point in time would be 4.5 per cent and above, but you probably in most cases need to meet monthly terms and conditions in order to get that rate on an ongoing basis,"" Ms Tindall said.

Meeting all the conditions can be incredibly confusing.

An Australian Competition and Consumer Commission report found that in the first six months of 2023, 71 per cent of accounts, on average, did not receive bonus interest in any given month.

That's why it's important to look at what's on offer, but choose a savings account that suits you, says wealth advisor Sulo Kulendran, from BDO Australia.

Sulo Kulendran says people should read the fine print when it comes to savings rates on offer. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine)

""It's really about going out there and seeing what's out in the market,"" she said.

A term deposit is another option, but it does have drawbacks.

""Longer-term investments, such as term deposits might have previously given a higher rate. It's not quite the case at the moment,"" she said.

"" The downside is you've got your money locked away. ""

Cameron has a large amount of savings in the bank and has been using the interest he earns to supplement his income from working.

Cameron has seen the interest he earns on his savings dwindle this year. (ABC News: Billy Draper)

The rate offered on his savings has fallen significantly — to about 4 per cent.

He tried shopping around, and thought he'd found fairly competitive rates, but the eligibility requirements were difficult to understand.

""When I looked at the various criteria that you had to have to be eligible for it actually got quite confusing in terms of you needed to have,"" he said.

""For instance, [you needed] your salary going into make a minimum number of payments from the bank account and there's certain stipulations which I found just a little bit sort of a barrier to me wanting to go down that path.""

Many Australians' savings are falling after the rate cuts. (Getty Images: Brent Lewin/Bloomberg)

Cameron also has a mortgage, but that's largely been offset, so the falling interest rate has not made much of a dent on his loan repayments.

Ms Kulendran says utilising an offset account is a sensible idea for households with a mortgage on their own home.

Australian economy grows 1.8pc Photo shows Welder works at InQuik Engineering in Newcastle. The Australian economy has grown slightly faster than economists were expecting thanks to a dramatic increase in household spending.

""Effectively what it does is it reduces the home loan balance on which the interest is charge,"" Ms Kulendran said.

""So, if your interest rate is, say 5.5 per cent, and you place some money into the offset, you're effectively getting a risk-free return of that 5.5 per cent for the amount that's sitting in the offset.""

Cameron is looking to upsize his two-bedroom property.

""Now, with the interest rates falling, I'm now looking to probably use those savings to put into a new property,"" he said.

""it's beneficial that the interest rate is obviously going down if I'm going to borrow more money to put against that property.""

The Reserve Bank next meets on the 29th and 30th of this month. However, most economists say a cut then is unlikely, given recent data, including stronger wage growth and prices.

"Haven't started on your tax return and feeling overwhelmed? Despite being something most of us tackle every year, lodging a tax return can easily end up at the bottom of your to-do list.

""Many families are experiencing financial stress during this cost-of-living crisis and, for some people, lodging their tax return may feel overwhelming,"" says Zena Burgess, CEO at the Australian Psychological Society.

""People may be concerned about receiving a tax bill, not filling out their details correctly, or it is simply a task that get pushed aside amongst life's unending to-do list.""

And while it's tempting to put it off, facing tasks you've been avoiding can feel rewarding and bring a sense of relief, says Dr Burgess.

It might also be helpful to know the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) ""would rather work with you than against you"", even if you are late in filing, explains Natalie Peng, a lecturer in accounting at the University of Queensland's School of Business.

Stress around money and life administrative tasks can have a significant impact on people, says Dr Burgess.

""Financial stress can cause significant problems, including difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, headaches, fatigue, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and feeling hopeless or helpless.

Where to start

Individual tax returns for the 2024/2025 financial year aren't due until October 31, so if you haven't done anything about that time frame yet, you're not behind.

But for those who are late on filing previous years, or fear they won't make the upcoming deadline, Dr Peng says it's important to deal with it as soon as possible.

"" Act now before interest and penalties start piling up. ""

She says ""not to panic"" and contact the ATO to let them know where you are at.

How to maximise your super this tax time Photo shows The hand of a man in a suit checking the ASX website on his phone at the ASX. With the end of the financial year approaching, tax agents say it is a good time to look at maximising your super.

For more tricky instances, perhaps where you are several years behind in tax, or have multiple jobs, Dr Peng recommends using a registered tax agent.

Working with a tax agent means you also have an extended deadline period for the previous financial year.

""A simple tax return might be $100 to $250, and that cost is tax deductible next year.""

Dr Peng says the ATO can help arrange payment plans if you are anticipating a tax bill.

Their website has a range of information that might be helpful for support in difficult times, explains Dr McInnes, such as natural disaster support and personal crisis support.

Break the process into smaller steps

If you're feeling overwhelmed about your tax return or other financial tasks, Dr Burgess recommends finding simple ways to get started.

""It can help to schedule a time, and a follow-up time, to approach the task and put it in your calendar,"" she says.

""Even if it is two or three weeks away, knowing that you have taken the step to set aside time will help ease the stress that avoidance can generate.""

Dr Burgess says if the task is not completed in that period, the follow up time is for finishing it.

""Like any task that feels initially overwhelming, it may help to break it down into small steps.

For example, the first scheduled time might be allocated simply for gathering the information and paperwork needed.

The benefit of getting on top of things

Dr Burgess says completing a task that you have been putting off can feel incredibly rewarding and bring with it a great sense of relief.

""When you remove the mental burden you have been carrying, you can often regain focus and the ability to move on to the next task with clarity.""

From a financial perspective, the longer you leave it, the more at risk you may be of a failure to lodge penalty.

And you may be entitled to a tax refund, explains Dr McInnes, so there is reason to prioritise lodgement.

To get ahead on the following year, Dr Peng recommends people set reminders, store receipts in a way that is helpful for them, and consider engaging a tax agent if the task historically gets away from you.

"No Spend September is kicking off on social media to help people save Last year, Lou Gibson — known as That Money Mum on Instagram — saved more than she expected by taking part in No Spend September.

She joined the social media challenge, sharing her experience with her followers and is aiming to give it another go this year.

""It's mainly to stop unconscious, habitual spending and to focus on all of the wonderful things in my life that are completely free,"" she explains.

Lou is part of a growing trend of people ditching takeaway coffees and winding back their spending for a few weeks in September.

What is No Spend September?

No Spend September has been growing as a trend on social media over the past few years, encouraging followers to cut discretionary spending — that is, unnecessary or avoidable expenses, as a kind of hard reset on finances.

Participants are encouraged to break down their spending and eliminate anything that isn't essential — including coffees, streaming subscriptions, online purchases and takeaway food for the month, while still allocating budget for rent, groceries and necessary expenses.

Ms Gibson says she was pleasantly surprised with last year's experience.

""More family time, park plays, long walks, and board games meant we didn't feel deprived,"" she says.

""It really made me question where all that money [we saved] normally goes and whether spending it unconsciously is really adding enough to our lives to justify it.""

This year she and her partner, who are both teachers at public schools, want to challenge themselves further by eliminating takeaway for the month.

""Cooking every night feels a bit foreign now, but I remember when we were kids we definitely didn't have takeaway once a week.""

Financial literacy advocate and accountant Ketvi Roopnarain says people love a challenge, and when it's limited to 30 days, it feels more achievable.

""We know there's an end in sight, and you're giving yourself space to try something. It's about pressing pause, versus stop, which makes us feel more comfortable with cutting something. If you just have to press pause for 30 days, suddenly you realise you can do another 10, and maybe another 10.""

Why do No Spend September?

Financial behaviour expert and author of Good With Money, Emma Edwards says challenges can be a useful way to recalibrate and change your habits.

""It's really easy nowadays to get stuck in cycles of convenience spending, overwhelm spending, or doom/dopamine spending.

Emma Edwards is a financial behaviour expert and author. (Supplied)

"" When we say we're not going to spend on certain things for a month, we allow our impulses, our triggers and our unmet needs to rise to the surface, and that awareness can be very powerful. ""

Loading...

Ms Roopnarain agrees, adding that it's an ideal time of year for a reset.

""Spring time is when you're taking a step back and spring cleaning, decluttering wardrobes.""

She says No Spend September is a good time to set measurable, realistic savings goals, which could jump-start your Christmas budgeting.

""Christmas is only four months away, September could be the time where you sit down and and decide you need $300 for Christmas gifts.""

No Spend may not be for everyone

For some, No Spend September may be a reality already, with the cost-of-living crisis squeezing people.

""For people who have already been really mindful of their spending this might not be the right thing. But perhaps there's another challenge there, like 'how do I bring more money in?'"" Ms Roopnarain says.

She recommends looking around the house to see if there are unused belongings that can be sold, in a different approach to the challenge.

""It might not be the right time for a no-spend challenge, but then perhaps there's a different challenge they might want to do, which might be how to bring in $300 over 30 days, or get rid of 30 things in 30 days.""

She also recommends looking at essentials like utility bills and telephone bills and seeing if there are savings to be made.

""You might say 'you know what, I'm going to call my energy provider and try and get a better deal,"" Ms Roopnarain says, ""Because that money saved could go towards the Christmas fund.""

Ms Roopnarain also says you can book a 30-minute call with your superannuation fund and speak with your bank about best available rates on loans.

Ms Edwards also cautions against taking spending challenges to the extreme.

They aren’t sustainable longer-term — and, as she points out, they’re not meant to be.

""You're not going to do a no spend challenge forever, it's meant to be a short term sprint, a concentrated period of focus.""

Being overly restrictive for longer periods can backfire down the line if you feel frustrated.

""Being overly restrictive can, for some people, actually create a rebellion cycle where we then spend more aggressively either during or after the challenge in order to reclaim a sense of control or buck the rules that are stifling us.""

Experts on the best options if you're short on money Photo shows An unidentified woman sitting on the floor with a calculator and bills around her If you’ve got an unexpected bill to pay or large expense and you don’t have the money to cover it, here’s what you can do.

Where to begin

Ms Roopnarain recommends starting with why you want to take on the challenge then setting some goals around how much you're aiming to save.

""The next steps are looking at what's essential and what's discretionary,"" she says.

Tracking your expenses will give you visibility and help celebrate wins.

For those curious about the challenge, Ms Edwards suggests trying rotating categories each week to start.

""Mix it up and rotate categories each week so you're focusing on just one area of spending at a time.""

And remember, aim for progress, not perfection.

""The key with these kinds of things is not aiming for perfection, but treating it as a learning experience instead,"" Ms Edwards says.

"" If you do No Spend September and you slip up and spend $50 one day, you're still better off than if you hadn't tried at all. ""

"SA's pokie losses exceed $1bn for first time, $24m in Mount Gambier alone More than $1 billion has been lost on poker machines in South Australia in the past year, with experts saying the issue is ""spiralling out of control"", as cost of living pressures encourage some people to gamble more.

Revenue from gaming machines in SA exceeded $1 billion for the first time over the 2024–25 financial year, up nearly $53 million from the previous 12 months.

Of that, over $453 million was collected by the state government, while venues shared in nearly $555 million over the past financial year.

Losses were high in regional areas, including $24 million across the Mount Gambier and Grant councils and $20.7 million in Whyalla.

They were even greater in several Adelaide suburban council areas, such as Salisbury and Port Adelaide Enfield, where annual gaming machine revenue exceeded $100 million, and Charles Sturt and Onkaparinga, where it exceeded $85 million.

The Alliance for Gambling Reform says losses are ""spiralling out of control"" across the country. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)

The Alliance for Gambling Reform's Martin Thomas said gambling losses were ""spiralling out of control"" across the country, with Australians losing about $32 billion annually to gambling.

""While that causes a huge amount of financial loss and harm, it's also causing terrible social harm across our community,"" he said.

Mr Thomas said while it is ""counterintuitive"", studies had shown some people were more likely to gamble when under financial pressure.

""Research shows that when people are doing it tough, sometimes it impairs their decision making and the idea of a windfall game, a dopamine hit and escapism — all these factors play into it,"" he said.

""The impacts are in a cost of living crisis are hugely profound. People go without food, people quite often can't pay their rent and it has dire consequences for families.""

Costs much more than losses

Monash University associate professor Charles Livingstone said while online betting was growing, representing ""around 30 per cent"" of wagering in Australia, pokies were ""still the biggest game in town"".

He said the social costs of gambling were likely far more significant than the amount people wager.

""The most recent study in Victoria estimated that the social costs from gambling [in Victoria] are around $14 billion a year, which is almost three times the amount that people gamble,"" he said.

""When you factor in all those costs, it doesn't look like such a good proposition and, of course, many of those costs are ultimately met by state governments.""

Online gambling has grown to about 30 per cent of all wagering in Australia. ( ABC News: Jasmine Hines )

Across SA's south-east alone, $42 million were lost on poker machines in 2024–25.

""Regions certainly have challenges with gambling because pubs and clubs, particularly when it comes to poker machines, are quite often, a central social place and a meeting place for people,"" Mr Thomas said.

""Sporting clubs, likewise, really form the heartbeat of many regional communities.

""Unfortunately, that's where poker machines are, and we hear countless stories of people who perhaps are playing football, and they're quite young and they start playing poker machines just as part of that culture and it's a bit of fun.

""But for some people it becomes a real obsession and causes enormous financial losses.""

Pokies a 'scourge on our state'

The Greens called on the SA government to commit to phasing out all pokies by 2030, calling them a ""scourge on our state"".

Greens MLC Robert Simms said poker machines had caused ""massive social harm"" since their introduction 30 years ago.

""There are established links between problem gambling, family violence and violent crime,"" Mr Simms said in a statement.

""It's completely unethical for the state government to continue to use poker machines to raise revenue when they have such a devastating impact on our community.""

Mr Simms urged the SA treasurer to commit to phasing out poker machines over the next five years and to establish a transition fund to support pubs and clubs to find alternative revenue streams, as had been proposed in other states.

""The state government should urgently take up these measures before even more lives are destroyed,"" he said.

""Instead of raising revenue from the gambling losses of struggling South Australians, the state government should instead be funding our essential services by scrapping subsidies for fossil fuel companies and imposing a big bank levy.""

Revenue important for venues

While the losses are significant, Australian Hotels Association SA chief executive Anna Moeller said the revenue from gaming machines could be ""a very important part of helping to make hotels viable"".

Anna Moeller says many hotels would not be viable without gaming machines. (ABC News: Imogen Hayne)

""They act as cross subsidisation, so it means that they can subsidise the cost of food, for example,"" she said.

""That's particularly important now where we've got a cost of living crisis so we're not having schnitzels that are costing $45.

""Did they not have the capability of incorporating gaming machines as part of their business model, there are many, many hotels that simply would not be viable.""

Ms Moeller said poker machines could also be more easily regulated than other online forms of gambling.

""South Australia is … the pin-up state in terms of harm minimisation in that space and regulations,"" she said.

""Your danger is that if you over regulate too much, you push people onto those other underground platforms that we don't have optics over.""

"Cost-of-living crisis forces regional South Australians into food insecurity and debt Richard and Kimberly Byers's lives fell apart quickly.

It started when Mr Byers was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

He was forced to temporarily shut his small business, which sold artificial flowers and farm fencing, in Adelaide while he received treatment, dipping into his superannuation to cover bills and other living costs.

By the time he could reopen, his customer base had disappeared. Soon, so too had the couple's savings.

Then, Mrs Byers suffered a spinal injury that needed emergency surgery.

Eight months on and still unable to work, the Byers could not even afford groceries.

'Drowning in debt' after a lifetime of work

In a bid to try and keep their heads above water, they sold their Adelaide home and moved 150 kilometres away to the small town of Snowtown, in the hope it would be more affordable.

But then the drought hit it, and prices rose.

Mr Byers's business still wouldn't pick up. He resorted to selling off stock to try and cover living expenses and their medical bills, but their debts continue to spiral.

""Not in a million years did I think I'd end up drowning in debt,"" Mr Byers said.

""Pride kept me from [asking for help], most probably; I've never asked anybody for anything in all my life.""

Isolated and struggling more than ever, Mrs Byers sought help from the hunger relief charity Foodbank.

It was a difficult pill for Mr Byers to swallow after a lifetime of running his own business and being financially secure.

""But by that point, we were in a situation where we really had no choice,"" he said.

Stories of struggle becoming more common

Two years on, the Byers are still reliant on Foodbank, and while they are still struggling, they have found a sense of community through the charity.

The stress from struggling to afford essentials has also lessened.

While the Byers's story is one filled with extremes, it is not uncommon, according to Foodbank.

Based on the charity's annual survey, the Hunger Report, about 3.4 million people are struggling with food insecurity across the country.

In South Australia, more than 140,000 people seek food relief each month — many juggling rising bills, and medical and food costs.

More than 60 per cent of people receiving that food assistance have jobs, and more than 30 per cent have mortgages.

No longer just the realm of the vulnerable

Traditionally, those who sought help from Foodbank were viewed as already vulnerable members of society due to housing insecurity or substance abuse issues, Foodbank SA and NT chief executive Greg Pattinson said.

But that has changed dramatically during the cost-of-living crisis, he said.

""It is no longer just the realms of homeless people or unemployed people with addiction issues, or any of those myriad of issues that cause problems,"" Mr Pattinson said.

""They're certainly still there, but by and large, the single biggest cause now of food insecurity is cost of living.""

According to the latest Australia Bureau of Statistics data, all household types saw rises in quarterly living costs in June 2025.

Richard and Kimberly Byers bring in the groceries they drove more than hour to pick up from Foodbank. (ABC North and West: Declan Durrant)

But, as with most issues, those costs are disproportionately affecting regional areas where more than 37 per cent of households now contend with food insecurity.

While May and June were record months for food distribution from Foodbank SA, that demand was highest in regional Australia, where people are 33 per cent more likely to experience food insecurity than those living in the cities.

""There's multiple reasons why,"" Mr Pattinson said.

""The lack of job opportunities, the costs of food and groceries, and just basic supplies is very expensive in some parts of Australia.

""The government, we know they're well aware of it, but it's a bit like turning the Titanic; it is a big, broad turning circle, and it takes a lot of time to do it.

""It's not something that can happen overnight. We're well aware that our services are going to be required for quite some time yet.""

Charity donors becoming charity recipients

Foodbank often asks people using its service if they are willing to share their stories — rarely do they agree.

The Byers said they were ashamed when they first started using the service; they had always been people who donated time to charities, not ones who needed their help.

But they changed their minds at the thought their story might help others who were struggling and feeling isolated.

The couple's story, when it was shared by Foodbank, saw the charity receive the most donations it had in years, Mr Pattinson said.

In Clare, where the Byers drive 35 minutes each way to get their groceries from a Foodbank Mobile Food Hub, the site has had record days of demand — as has every Foodbank site in the state.

The Foodbank Mobile Hub — a van filled with produce that travels to the town every month — attracts people from across the region.

In late July, demand was high, with about 100 people dropping in for their groceries.

The Byers know many of them and their stories.

""Most people that come have similar circumstances [to us],"" Mrs Byers said.

""Whether the medical stuff or having kids or the rent prices.

""Everyone has their stories; they're here for the same reason.

""Any way we can help is enough.""

Honouring a family tradition

According to Ms Stanton, outback women have taken comfort in their flower gardens for generations, as proof that even the fragile can survive in the harshest of climates.

Growing up on a sheep station near Longreach in western Queensland, she has endured many a drought.

""Life on the land is wonderful on one hand but incredibly hard on the other,"" Ms Stanton said.

"Residents encouraged to attract native bees amid varroa mite spread Did you know that one in three food items you eat is dependent on the pollination of a bee?

Picture yourself walking down the fruit and veggie aisle at your local supermarket, looking at the apples, tomatoes, avocados, and cherries you will likely put in your trolley.

Even the lemons you pick from your own garden would not be available in abundance without the pollination of our bees.

So, why is it important now more than ever to help promote pollination in your own backyard?

Pollination importance

The deadly honey bee parasite, varroa mite, was detected in South Australia for the first time earlier this month.

It made the state the fifth jurisdiction to detect the pest after a discovery was made in the Riverland during a beehive consignment surveillance check.

If the mite reaches the feral bee population, also known as the European honey bee, 95 per cent of the species could be wiped out, the Department of Primary Industries and Regions South Australia (PIRSA) said.

About two-thirds of Australian agricultural production benefits from insect pollination, most of which is provided by European honey bees, according to AgriFutures Australia.

Beekeeper and honey producer in South Australia's Riverland, Kerry Chambers, said residents with backyard beehives should be learning about their roles and responsibilities when monitoring their hives for varroa mite.

""[Backyard beekeepers] need to ensure they're registered with PIRSA and that they're getting all of the information they need to know about how to manage this,"" she said.

While the threat to the feral honey bee remained high, Ms Chambers said there were ways to protect them.

Swarming usually happens in spring as the weather warms up and flowers start to bloom.

Native plants help

Native bees cannot be hosts of varroa mite, according to the CSIRO.

And while not all native species pollinate agricultural crops, the presence of native wildflowers contributes to higher biodiversity.

Tim Field says it is important to plant native crops that attract bees. (ABC Riverland: Amelia Walters)

Loxton-based Riverland Native Plants owner, Tim Field, said planting multiple native varieties in different sizes and providing accessible drinking water was ""a good place to start"" in boosting native bee populations.

""Having things that flower throughout the year is a really good thing to have so you keep them coming back and keep them happy,"" he said.

""Emu bushes, or eremophilas, [are] a drought-tolerant, arid type of plant.

""They come in everything from ground covers through to trees.

"How to give your indoor plants a spring clean As gardens, parks and nature strips start showing signs of spring, our indoor plants might need a little help to jump into the new season.

If, on inspection, you find yellowing leaves, collapsing stems and dusty foliage, an indoor plant spring clean may be called for.

Here's what you can do to give them a boost.

Inspect, top-up soil and trim

Tamara Campbell says spring marks the start of the growing season, which means ""warmer, longer days"". (Supplied: Tamara Campbell)

The owner of an indoor plant store in Naarm/Melbourne, horticulturalist Tamara Campbell, recommends using spring as an opportunity to inspect your plants.

She checks for pests, anything that needs to be trimmed or pruned back and soil levels.

If soil levels have dropped, Ms Campbell says some plants might benefit from a top-up of fresh potting mix, while others might require repotting (more on that below).

Sign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You’ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.

Greg Moore is a senior research associate at the University of Melbourne with an interest in horticultural plant science, revegetation and ecology.

Dr Moore says ""[it's a] good time to top up the mulch on top of the pot and to fertilise plants if you are not going to repot"".

To maintain a ""good shape"" and keep indoor plants looking lush, he recommends trimming with secateurs to remove dead leaves and twigs.

Dust your leaves

Removing dust from your plants can have an impact on their health and overall appearance.

Ms Campbell says by growing plants indoors we're already limiting their access to natural light and a layer of dust makes getting enough light even harder.

A layer of dust is ""like putting a curtain over them"" and cleaning the leaves allows ""the maximum amount of light to penetrate"".

The result, according to Ms Campbell, is a visibly healthier plant.

For a spring clean, she hoses her indoor plants outside, removing any dust from the pot and the plant. Hosing also allows water to flush completely through the pot.

Tamara Campbell says dusting the leaves regularly will help the plant absorb light and stay healthy. (ABC Lifestyle: Anna Chisholm)

Repotting plants

Feeling bad about not repotting? You may not need to Photo shows A collection of pants including monsteras, a fiddle leaf fig and devil's ivy sit next to a wall with a lamp and guitar. If you love house plants but hate repotting, there are plants that need it a lot less than others.

If any of your indoor plants need repotting, Dr Moore and Ms Campbell agree that it's a good time of year to get stuck in.

Dr Moore says repotting now ""as the plants are just starting to get going after winter"" will allow them to get the ""maximum benefit"".

Ms Campbell recommends using a potting mix suited to the type of plant.

For example, for a Swiss cheese plant, elephant's ear or peace lily, Ms Campbell would use a ""chunky aroid mix that drains quickly, allows for air around the roots but also has water holding capacity in the large particles"".

Staking plants

While giving your plants a spring refresh, it's worth considering whether any need to be staked or re-staked.

Plant enthusiast Mike Sullivan shares plant care tips on social media and makes and sells his own plant stakes and planters.

He says it's best to stake Swiss cheese plants (Monstera deliciosa) straight away to avoid the ""hunchback monstera, or sad-looking splayed-out monstera"" scenario.

But Mr Sullivan says mature plants can be staked too. It mimics the support a tree trunk would offer in nature and helps avoid stems breaking.

He also notes that it's best to avoid rotating Swiss cheese plants constantly if you want them to grow in their natural form (with their leaves hanging at the front and their stem or spine at the back).

Longer and warmer spring days will also likely alter the natural light in your home.

Ms Campbell says part of setting your plant up for success is positioning them to ensure adequate light.

Dr Moore says good light is essential for indoor plants, ""but no so much as to scorch leaves"".

He also recommends checking ""where the ducts to your air conditioning and your heating are"" and moving plants out of the path of that air.

"The simple system I use for composting Shortly after moving into my rental in 2017, I delightedly discovered three compost bays already built down the back of the garden.

It took me five years to realise those cruddy old bays were the main reason every batch of compost I made sucked.

The open bays were a magnet for rats and cockroaches, and everything inside quickly dried out in Tarntanya/Adelaide's often-hot weather, hampering the decomposition process.

I’ve since devised a simpler system that transforms my food scraps and plant prunings into ""garden gold"" – which I return to my veggie beds to feed my soil and grow plentiful organic food.

Swapping to enclosed plastic compost bins

After buying my rental house in 2022, I scored a round plastic compost bin free from a neighbour, which I'd planned to use temporarily while I rebuilt the open bays.

Turns out, the plastic bin is far easier to use and maintain in my context.

It works almost like a self-watering system: the lid traps moisture from the composting greens and also keeps rain from soaking the pile.

Protect your plants from pests Photo shows Koren Helbig smiling in her Adelaide garden with two raised veggie patches behind her and an outdoor table. Whether you're growing indoors or out, prevention is often better than cure when dealing with pests. Here are my DIY measures.

Another unexpected bonus is portability — I can move the bin around my garden, placing it beside hungry fruit trees where any nutrient-rich runoff will do the most good.

After sourcing several more bins cheaply second-hand, I set up a simple three-bin rotation. One is always in active use, taking in new scraps and prunings; another is resting and breaking down; and the third is finished compost, ready to feed my garden.

The critically acclaimed Mystery Road: Origin returns as Detective Jay Swan (Mark Coles Smith) and Mary (Tuuli Narkle) uncover dark secrets in a haunted timber town, where the past threatens to tear them apart.

Adding oxygen with a corkscrew tool and 'DIY lung'

A big issue with my old open bays was turning the compost — my chronic back injury renders the shovelling and heavy lifting a no-go.

But regular turning is crucial to get oxygen into the pile so microbes can do their job. Without it, compost can go anaerobic — breaking down without oxygen, turning slimy and smelly, and slowing decomposition down.

Then I discovered the compost aerator: a corkscrew-style tool that costs about $30.

Winter is a good time to turn compost. I use a spiral aerator tool which makes for less strain on my back. (Supplied: Koren Helbig)

Now, I can easily twist the aerator down into the small compost pile, pull it back up and voilà — oxygen added without much heavy lifting.

To help add even more oxygen, I followed advice from Kate Flood’s excellent book The Compost Coach — and made a ""DIY lung""

A simple ""DIY lung"" made from PVC pipe and placed in the centre of the plastic bin gives the compost pile plenty of oxygen, which prevents if going slimy and slows decomposition. (Supplied: Koren Helbig)

It’s just a length of PVC pipe, drilled with holes and plonked in the bin’s centre, providing a constant oxygen injection directly to the pile's heart.

What goes into my compost bins

Food waste dumped into landfill breaks down anaerobically, creating greenhouse gases as it rots. And while council-run green bin pick-ups do a decent job of composting food and garden waste, that system relies on trucks, fuel and energy-intensive commercial processing.

So, I try to compost as much as I can at home — it's lower-impact and keeps nutrients cycling through my garden.

I build my compost by alternating layers of:

Nitrogen-rich ""greens"": fruit and veggie scraps, funky leftovers, garden prunings, spent plants, chicken manure, coffee grounds collected from a local cafe and even food waste rescued from a supermarket bin. I also include meat, bones, citrus and onions, in moderation.

fruit and veggie scraps, funky leftovers, garden prunings, spent plants, chicken manure, coffee grounds collected from a local cafe and even food waste rescued from a supermarket bin. I also include meat, bones, citrus and onions, in moderation. Carbon-rich ""browns"": dry leaves, shredded paper, newspaper, straw and chopped fruit tree prunings.

The trick is balance. Too much nitrogen quickly turns the pile into a soggy, smelly mess. So, every time I add ""greens"", I also toss in a handful of dry, carbon-rich material for balance.

With my old open bays, I had no chance of keeping vermin out. In the enclosed plastic bins, it’s much easier.

I now wrap a sheet of stainless-steel mesh around the bin's base to stop rodents tunnelling up from below, while still allowing drainage and soil contact.

I’ve also learnt an untouched compost bin quickly becomes a cosy, familiar hideout packed with food. I prevent this by turning my compost roughly monthly.

How I use my finished compost

I used to pull my compost out too early, before it had a chance to fully cure. But with my three-bin rotation, each batch now gets at least three months to rest, which I’ve found is the bare minimum for a rich, crumbly result.

Once cured, I sift the compost to remove chunky bits. These either go back into an active bin to finish breaking down or under my fruit trees as a rough mulch.

The final sifted compost can be added into the hole when planting something new or layered over the surface of an entire garden. (Supplied: Koren Helbig)

I use the final sifted product in two ways — either adding a handful into the hole whenever planting something new or topping up an entire garden bed by spreading a 2–4cm layer across the surface.

"Is the pink soap scum in my bathroom mould, or something else? Black mould showing up in a bathroom usually signals a proper clean is in order.

But have you ever noticed a pink or orange-coloured substance in the tile grout or around taps?

In most cases, it's one of two things, explains Michael Taylor, an expert in mould and adjunct academic with Flinders University.

We look at what those are, how to deal with them, and whether they can make you sick.

When it's mould

The pink slime may be a type of micro fungi, also called a mould, named Rhodotorula, explains Dr Taylor.

""It's more like a yeast. It makes a slimy coating around itself and will happily live in wet environments.""

He says Rhodotorula can be found almost anywhere, including on and in the wet bits of your skin.

While Rhodotorula poses no risk to healthy people, Dr Taylor says it can cause infection in those with weakened immune systems.

Removing mould from your home Photo shows Woman wearing mask and pink gloves cleans her home, in a story about how to clean mould after rain. After a wet few weeks one task you may be facing is cleaning up mould in your home. But there are things to know before you do.

When it's bacteria

The more likely cause of the pink scum in your bathroom is a bacteria called Serratia marcescens, says Dr Taylor.

It's another microbe that thrives in damp and humid conditions.

""It also makes a slimy, mucus coating — a biofilm — which is what lets it persist in these environments.

""It also lets it soak up nutrients to live … these sticky coatings let them sort of grab little bits of food as they float by and use those to grow.""

Dr Taylor says the bacteria belongs to a group of pathogens known as ""opportunists"".

""If conditions are right, say [a] person exposed is immunocompromised … [the bacteria] may find a cut or something like that they can get into, and slowly do their thing.""

That may be causing a mild infection that could turn into something more serious, like pneumonia, and require treatment, explains Dr Taylor.

But most people are generally not at risk of Serratia infections.

""It doesn't really do us any harm.""

And it's hard to say exactly how ""risky"" the bacteria is, because how it impacts someone depends on their immune system.

""It's really individual whether or not you will be susceptible and how serious it is likely to be.""

How to clean pink soap scum

Dr Taylor says it's a misconception to think you can ever make your bathroom completely sterile, but there are ways to reduce the presence of mould and bacteria.

Recommendations from Dr Taylor and Dr Whitelaw include:

Drying wet areas to reduce the moisture that helps mould and bacteria grow.

"Jennifer Hudson says playing queen of soul Aretha Franklin in movie biopic all about respect When Jennifer Hudson auditioned for American Idol almost two decades ago, she belted out lyrics from the queen of soul, Aretha Franklin. It was a dream realised.

Hudson couldn't have imagined that years on Franklin would be tapping her on the shoulder to depict her in a biopic about her life.

""We met over 15 years ago about me portraying her,"" Hudson told ABC News Breakfast.

Hudson was among a handful of artists who paid tribute to Aretha Franklin at her funeral in 2018. (Supplied: Instagram)

""So it's amazing to me to see it manifest now after all this time. It was also a dream of mine to want to play her.

"" It's so bizarre to me that I even sang her song for my audition for American Idol. ""

Hudson's ties to Franklin are strong. Alongside Chaka Khan, Ronald Isley and Stevie Wonder, Hudson sang at Franklin's funeral at Detroit's Greater Grace Temple in 2018.

Franklin's civil rights legacy

Franklin's music sits firmly within the context of the civil rights era. Her songs have been called the soundtrack of the movement in the US.

""That's one of the beautiful things about the film, to learn about what moved her as a person and who was a part of her life,"" Hudson said.

Franklin's father was a Baptist minister who organised the 1963 Detroit Walk to Freedom, one of the largest civil rights demonstrations in the US. (Supplied: Instagram)

Franklin's family were key figures of the civil rights movement.

The moment Aretha's star was born Photo shows Aretha Franklin performs at Radio City Music Hall during the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. It was January 1967 and those in the room knew they were seeing something special. And Aretha Franklin didn't disappoint, going on to be the black American female singer who would take soul music into the pop charts.

Her father, CL Franklin, was a Baptist minister and the organiser of the 1963 Detroit Walk to Freedom.

The demonstration was the largest civil rights protest in the US until the March on Washington superseded it later that year.

Reverend Martin Luther King Jr often visited Franklin's family home in Detroit and she would later sing at his funeral after his assassination in 1968.

""I mean, when you hear about it from afar, you can tell how connected they really were,"" Hudson said.

"" For her to use her platform to be a voice and an advocate associated to the civil rights era, to be connected to Dr King, it makes her legacy that much more powerful and impactful. ""

How did Hudson prepare for the role?

Reflecting on the role, Hudson said there were challenging moments because of what Franklin's had come to represent — from her catalogue of songs to her activism during the civil rights movement.

""Because again, I'm a fan, so I get it, I understand how prestigious it is [to have this role],"" Hudson said.

""And so you want to be able to nail those nuances and those things and traits that are familiar to us all.""

Hudson's training was rigorous. She was intent on ensuring her performance on the big screen paid respect to Franklin.

She even taught herself to play the piano.

""Yes, that was the first thing that I did in preparing to play Ms Franklin,"" she said.

""I can't say I'm committing to this as an actress, playing someone who was a genius of a pianist, without learning the element of the piano in some way.""

It's all about respect for Hudson

Hudson struggles to pinpoint her favourite ballad from Franklin's long, storied career.

""That's the hardest question to answer and it was the hardest thing to dwindle down to in the film, like what we cover, she said.

""As far as songs, Respect was the song that stopped me in my tracks. I was like, 'Wait a minute — I get to sing Respect?'""

Hudson described Franklin's hit song Respect as an anthem she carried for inspiration.

""I have it on my neck [as a necklace] actually, right here … that's what it means to me,"" she said.

""I make sure I have that symbol with me everywhere I go.""

"Kool and the Gang co-founder Dennis Thomas dies in his sleep aged 70 Dennis ""Dee Tee"" Thomas, a founding member of the long-running soul-funk band Kool & the Gang known for such hits as Celebration and Get Down On It, has died. He was 70.

Key points: Dennis Thomas was born on February 9, 1951

He was known for his distinctive clothes and hats

Kool & The Gang won two Grammy Awards and seven American Music Awards

He died in his sleep Saturday in New Jersey, where he lived in the suburb of Montclair, according to a statement from his representative.

Thomas was the alto sax player, flutist and percussionist.

He served as master of ceremonies at the band's shows and his last appearance with the group was July 4 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.

Born on February 9, 1951, in Orlando, Florida, Thomas was known for his prologue on the band's 1971 hit, Who's Gonna Take the Weight.

Known for his distinctive clothes and hats, he was also the group's wardrobe stylist.

In the early days, he served as their budget hawk, carrying their earnings in a paper bag stuffed into the bell of his horn, the statement said.

In 1964, seven teenage friends created the group's unique blend of jazz, soul and funk, at first calling themselves the Jazziacs.

They went through several iterations before settling on Kool & the Gang in 1969.

The group's other founders are brothers Ronald and Robert Bell, Spike Mickens, Ricky Westfield, George Brown and Charles Smith.

Ronald Bell died September 9, 2020, at home in the US Virgin Islands aged 68.

The band earned two Grammy Awards and seven American Music Awards.

They were honoured in 2014 with a Soul Train Lifetime Achievement Award.

Their music is heavily sampled and featured on film soundtracks, including those for Rocky, Saturday Night Fever and Pulp Fiction.

Among those Thomas is survived by are his wife, Phynjuar Saunders Thomas, daughter Tuesday Rankin and sons David Thomas and Devin Thomas.

"As huge music festivals return in the US, Australian promoters plan post-lockdown events Major summer music festivals have returned in the United States, leaving some health experts concerned and concert promoters in Australia working on plans for safe post-lockdown events.

Key points: Since Lollapalooza, some attendees have shared COVID-19 test results on social media

The Delta variant now makes up more than 80 per cent of new COVID-19 cases in the US

Promoters of some of Australia's largest festivals are working on plans for post-lockdown events

Last weekend, hundreds of thousands of people made their way through Chicago's Grant Park for the Lollapalooza music festival, despite a surge in the highly transmissible Delta variant of COVID-19.

The four-day event drew about 100,000 people each day, and this year's lineup – featuring the likes of Foo Fighters, Miley Cyrus and Tyler, the Creator – was one of the first major festivals in the US since the start of the pandemic.

Photos of the event's enormous crowds have shocked many, including epidemiologist Marylouise McLaws from the University of New South Wales, who is among a group of experts who have provided advice to Lollapalooza's parent company, Live Nation, about how to hold future events safely in Australia.

Live Nation has a controlling stake in Australian festivals such as Splendour in the Grass and Falls Festival, and the Australian iteration of Download Festival.

To attend this year's Lollapalooza, ticketholders in Chicago had to either be fully vaccinated (and prove this with a vaccination card) or receive a negative test result in the previous 72 hours.

Live Nation worked with local health officials and adhered to their regulations, the company said. This meant there was no mask mandate, until day three when masks were made compulsory in the festival's indoor spaces.

Chicago is currently seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations.

A little more than 50 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated, but the city of 3 million people is recording about 250 new cases per day – similar to what Sydney has been recording in the past week of its Delta outbreak.

The Delta variant now makes up more than 80 per cent of new COVID-19 cases in the US, according to the country's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Upon seeing images of the huge crowds at Lollapalooza, University of Chicago infection prevention and control executive medical director Emily Landon took to Twitter to express her concerns, which have been dismissed by Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot as coming from ""critics on the sidelines"".

Doctor Allison Arwady from the Chicago Department of Public Health said while no event was completely safe from COVID-19, she was happy with the precautions in place at Lollapalooza.

""It's not a zero-risk situation... We expect to see some cases associated with it, just because of the sheer number of folks,"" she told WGN.

Since the festival, some Lollapalooza attendees have shared their COVID-19 test results on social media.

""I'm fully vaccinated and woke up with body aches, sore throat, stuffy nose, and a headache,"" one attendee wrote on Reddit, adding that they later tested positive.

""Based on when I tested [positive] I probably had it while I was at [Lollapalooza] but contracted it before,"" wrote another.

Video on social media also shows a crowd breaking down a fence to gain entry to the festival, without being checked for vaccination or a negative test.

Lollapalooza organisers claimed 90 per cent of attendees showed vaccination cards proving they were fully inoculated, but vaccinated people can still transmit the virus and vaccination cards can be forged.

Chicago Tribune photo intern Vashon Jordan Jr, who covered the festival, said that fake vaccination cards were being used by some people, despite earlier warnings of ""hefty fines and prison time"" from the FBI.

UNSW's Professor McLaws said festival organisers should remember that COVID-19 vaccines weren't 100 per cent effective.

""People can still get breakthrough infections and symptomatic disease, and while the viral load may be lower, given there's no social distancing, this will increase the risk of spread,"" she said.

In an op-ed published by Billboard, Lollapalooza founder Perry Farrell said he was proud of this year's event, but couldn't guarantee there wouldn't be COVID-19 infections.

""I'm not going to say that nobody is going to catch anything, because it's beyond me, but I can tell you that we really set a course in the right direction — and for that, I'm happy,"" he said.

How have other festivals fared?

Several COVID-19 cases have reportedly been linked to hip-hop festival Rolling Loud (also operated by Live Nation), which took place in Miami, Florida last month.

The event did not require attendees to wear masks, be vaccinated or show a negative test, in accordance with local laws, despite the state experiencing a spike in new cases and hospitalisations.

Rapper Dess Dior announced she had tested positive for COVID-19 after performing at Rolling Loud. As did some attendees who posted their positive results to social media.

Last month in the Netherlands, unvaccinated people were allowed to attend the Verknipt music festival in Utrecht, as long as they had a negative test within 40 hours of entering.

There were 20,000 people in attendance with no masks or social distancing, and about 1,000 festival-goers are known to have become infected with COVID-19 over the two-day event.

An outlier last month was Serbia's EXIT Festival, which welcomed about 45,000 people per day for four days, and recorded no COVID-19 infections according to a study published a week after the event.

All attendees were required to be fully vaccinated or return a negative test on entry.

What can Australia learn?

Countless Australian concert tours and festivals have been postponed or cancelled in recent months, including during the latest Delta outbreaks in major cities.

Live Nation's Splendour in the Grass, one of Australia's largest festivals, is still scheduled to take place in Byron Bay this November, after being cancelled last year and hosting a virtual event last month.

Live Nation, which holds a 30-year lease of Melbourne's Palais Theatre, says it is working with health experts to design safe events.

Since May, the Palais Theatre has been in discussions with Professor McLaws, public health consultant Henning Liljeqvist and the Australian arm of Swiss healthcare company Roche Diagnostics about the design and application of various types of testing (including rapid antigen testing) both at home and at the concert venue.

""Palais Theatre is proud to lead the way back to live entertainment by working with leading health experts to investigate various testing protocols so we can connect fans to the artists and events they love,"" a Palais Theatre representative said.

Splendour in the Grass didn't go ahead in 2020, but is scheduled to return this November. (AAP: Regi Varghese)

Professor McLaws said that in an ideal world, all concert-goers would have to undergo a rapid antigen test when entering an event, and anyone who tested positive would need a secondary rapid PCR test to confirm that result.

She said social distancing was important, and masks may be necessary even in outdoor areas if people can't distance.

""People don't want to sit on a chair and listen to music when they want to get up and dance, but you can zone it in such a way that it prevents people from crowding,"" she said.

""But you've got even less problems if you've got people who have tested negative, regardless if they've had the vaccine or not.

""Then you've really got a high probability that you're dealing with a safe event.""

Professor McLaws said she was concerned public and private pathology companies were not endorsing rapid antigen tests, which were relatively low cost and had been approved by Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration.

She said it was a positive thing that Live Nation wanted to continue to host events with public health in mind.

""Concerts can be done safely, but it does take some planning,"" she said.

Other music festivals such as Byron Bay Bluesfest and the Mundi Mundi Bash are still up in the air, amid the latest New South Wales Delta outbreak.

Byron Bay Bluesfest organisers hoped their event could go ahead in October after being cancelled for two consecutive years, but they could not confirm it was going to happen, they said in a statement this week.

""As the clusters begin to pop up in more places and continue to grow exponentially, a reschedule of our October event is becoming ever more likely,"" they said.

""With the current situation, we are not confident that we can deliver a safe and successful event in October — and, in the end, that's the bottom line.""

Queensland's Gympie Music Muster was recently cancelled for the second year in a row, as interstate borders closed amid the growing crisis in New South Wales.

North Queensland's Groovin The Moo has also been cancelled twice, and its spin-off event Fresh Produce isn't going ahead either.

Testing, masks and zoning may be key

Last month, Spanish scientists researching COVID-19 at an indoor concert with 5,000 people without physical distancing found that same-day rapid testing, the use of face masks and improved ventilation led to very low rates of transmission.

Of the 4,584 attendees who were analysed, six cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the two weeks following the concert.

Three of the cases were believed to have been caught after the event, while one person potentially attended the concert during their incubation period.

The source of the other two cases couldn't be identified.

Professor McLaws said there was no need for concern about COVID-19 spreading at music events if strict public health measures, including masks and same-day rapid testing, were in place.

She said zoning at festivals could also allow organisers to identify those at risk of contracting COVID-19, if someone in a certain zone was to test positive after the event.

US braces for more major events

Chicago is still set to host large music events such as Pitchfork Music Festival and Riot Fest next month.

For both festivals, attendees would need to be fully vaccinated or have proof of a negative test in order to enter.

In the same month, New York City will become the first US city to enforce a vaccine mandate for certain public events, with concert-goers required to show proof of at least partial vaccination before entering an indoor venue.

It's a move Dr Landon from the University of Chicago hopes will be adopted in her city, where officials show no plans to tighten their restrictions.","As huge music festivals return in the US, Australian promoters plan post-lockdown events",Music,N/A,Abc,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-06/music-festivals-us-australia-promoters-covid-lockdown/100350478,2021-08-06 00:00:00,"Major music festivals have returned in the U.S., raising concerns among health experts as the Delta variant of COVID-19 spreads.

"Documentary series about 1971 examines explosive influence of John Lennon, Tina Turner, Marvin Gaye and more — on music and the world From Marvin Gaye's What's Going On and John Lennon's Imagine to Joni Mitchell's Blue and Carole King's Tapestry — 1971 was a huge year for music.

""When you look at the records and the tracks that were produced or written or charted that year, it was astonishing,"" says Danielle Peck, a director and producer of the new Apple TV+ docuseries 1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything.

Listen to The Screen Show Tune in for the latest news, interviews and reviews.

The eight-episode series, directed by Asif Kapadia (Amy), is based on David Hepworth's 2016 book Never a Dull Moment: 1971 — The Year That Rock Exploded.

""[Hepworth] was coming of age [in 1971] and everybody thinks that the time they came of age was the best year ever — so I went in thinking, 'OK, hang on a second',"" Peck told The Screen Show.

""But actually I became a convert.""

The series suggests that The Rolling Stones, Aretha Franklin and Sly and the Family Stone were producing some of the best albums of their careers in 1971. It was also a breakthrough year for David Bowie and Elton John.

But more than merely a compendium of great albums, the series presents a group portrait of artists who were proactively shaping pop culture and politics.

""[The series] is about literally what's going on in the world, who is saying what, who is doing what and how that's [still] influencing now,"" says Kapadia.

'Records scratch'

Kapadia is the director of critically acclaimed documentaries Amy, Senna and Diego Maradona. 1971 cleaves to his established style; there are no talking heads — instead, interview recordings are layered over archival footage.

""It puts the audience in the present and into that moment,"" says Kapadia.

The creative team recorded 100 new interviews for the series. But Peck says: ""Even with people who are alive it was sometimes really more advantageous going with archival interviews, because the fog of time really messes people's memories up.""

It was in those archival interviews that they found ""magic lines"", including the David Bowie sentence that appears in the series' opening sequence: ""We were creating the 21st century in 1971.""

“Things that are, I suppose, imperfect are more interesting to me,” says Kapadia (pictured here Tina Turner). (Supplied: Apple TV+)

Much of the archival footage featured — including never-before-seen home movie footage of Joni Mitchell shot by Graham Nash while they were dating — is rough and ready rather than professional and polished.

""It's a battle that I've been personally waging since Senna … where I had to get everyone to buy into the idea of: if it's real and it's authentic and it's the only time there was a camera there, then I'm gonna use it, because anything else is fake,"" says Kapadia.

""[I'm] not scared of film and grain and texture and scratches because that's the part of [the world]; records scratch, they sound dirty and glitchy.

"" The series is actually much more authentic by being made in that way, than if it had been hyper-digital and clean. ""

In the series, Kapadia, Peck and the series' other director James Rogan zoom in on, crop and reframe their mountains of archival footage.

""I've always thought of documentaries in the same way I do fiction films, where everything is constructed,"" says Kapadia.

""Everything you hear and see is created, is a lie, it's been edited … You've got to do a lot of manipulation in order to make it feel authentic.""

What's Going On

The series opens in an America divided over the Vietnam War, with the killing of four anti-war protesters at Kent State University that inspired Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's protest anthem Ohio.

Gaye's What's Going On was about poverty, discrimination and the Vietnam war. (Supplied: Apple TV+)

It is in this atmosphere that Marvin Gaye, whose brother had been drafted into the war, wrote his seductively beautiful protest song (and album of the same name): What's Going On.

As Black Panther member Billy X Jennings says in the episode: ""When that album came out Marvin Gaye reset the whole situation.""

Other episodes focus on Carole King and Joni Mitchell's iconic feminist albums Tapestry and Blue, Elton John and Lou Reed's exploration of queer music and culture, and how James Brown and Ike and Tina Turner navigated racism in the music industry.

While the series focuses on 1971, it also covers events from 1969 (the disastrous Altamont Speedway Free Concert and the Manson murders) and 1970 (the shootings at Kent State and the break-up of The Beatles).

""[Pre-1971 is] sort of touched on in the [Hepworth] book, but it really came together when we started looking at the archives,"" says Peck.

But it was 1971 when both Manson and leader of the My Lai massacre Lieutenant William Calley were put on trial and sentenced. John Lennon and Yoko Ono moved to the US and The Rolling Stones released Sticky Fingers, their first album since the Altamont concert tragedy.

""So a lot of the stuff was simmering and maturing in 71,"" Peck says.

Aside from brief forays into reggae and Kraftwerk, the series is limited to the music of the English-speaking world (pictured here The Staple Singers). (Supplied: Apple TV+)

The series also covers the influence of Australian intellectuals on pop culture, via Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch, and the Oz Magazine obscenity trial.

Kapadia says: ""The music and pop culture and intellectuals and all of them [were] crossing over … [and] everything that was going on at the time somehow influenced politicians.""

1971/2021

Watching the series, one is struck by the echoes of 1971 heard in today's politics, protests and social movements.

""There are lots of the journeys that we are still experiencing that started in 71,"" says Peck.

An episode about the Attica prison riot and massacre feels like a natural prologue to the Black Lives Matter movement, while the music of Aretha Franklin, Curtis Mayfield and Gil Scott-Heron is read as an expression of the deep-seated racial unrest in America.

Other episodes track how identity politics emerged in 1971.

""The 60s seemed to be all about all of us together …. and 71 is where it seemed to fragment into these different interest groups: you had gay rights, women's rights, Black Power emerging,"" says Peck.

“This wasn't created because we thought, ‘there's a bad politician in the US and maybe we should make a series about that’, it all somehow came into sync,"" says Kapadia, whose series features activist Angela Davis, pictured. (Supplied: Apple TV+)

Of course, watching the series also throws into relief the enormous changes that have occurred in the last 50 years.

""Now you have people who are influencers who haven't done anything … they open boxes on YouTube and they influence millions,"" Kapadia laments.

""[Contemporary] artists appear to be more interested in how many followers they've got, how much money they're making, as opposed to feeling that they have the will and the power to make a change and say something.""

Peck acknowledges that there are still artists making powerful political work, including American multi-hyphenate Childish Gambino and British rapper Dave.

""So there are these shining moments but … it doesn't seem to become part of the wider culture,"" she says.

Though as Kapadia points out, it might all look very different with the benefit of hindsight.

"" Someone will look back on in 20 years' time, 10 years' time and realise this was a pivotal moment in 2021. When you're in the middle of it, it's hard to see. ""

"How Life On Mars? evolved from Sinatra revenge to Bowie epitaph over 50 years When David Bowie died in 2016, fans and musicians had an enormous catalogue of songs to sift through to find the perfect one to sum up his career, influence and death.

One song that featured prominently in tributes to the musical icon was Life On Mars?, a piano-led ballad from his 1971 album Hunky Dory that captured the poetry and creativity of Bowie at his best as well as the emotion and melancholy of his passing.

Fifty years on from its recording in August 1971, the song stands as an epitaph to this remarkable musician, which makes it all the more bizarre to realise Life On Mars? was born out of revenge against Ol' Blue Eyes himself, Frank Sinatra.

'It's a god-awful small affair…'

In 1968, Bowie was an ambitious songwriter with several failed bands and a low-selling debut solo album in his wake.

Keen to flex his songwriting muscles wherever possible, Bowie took on assignments from his publishing company to compose new English lyrics to foreign pop songs.

Among them was a 1967 French song called Comme d'habitude.

""I wrote some really terrible lyrics [to it] — I think it was called Even A Fool Learns To Love,"" Bowie told Michael Parkinson in a 2002 interview.

""I sent it back again and I thought that will be the last I hear of that.

""Then I hear it on the radio and I thought 'That's that tune, it must be my song … but hang on, these are different lyrics', and it was Sinatra singing My Way.""

Unbeknown to Bowie, songwriter Paul Anka had purchased the rights to Comme d'habitude, rewritten it as the now-famous swan song, and gifted it to Frank Sinatra.

""That really made me angry for so long — for about a year,"" Bowie joked to Parkinson.

""Eventually I thought, 'I can write something as big as that, and I'll write one that sounds a bit like it'.

"" So I did Life On Mars?, which was my sort of revenge trip on My Way. ""

Five things about Life On Mars? David Bowie's epic song Life On Mars? was recorded in August 1971 Rick Wakeman's piano parts were recorded on the same piano Paul McCartney used to record The Beatles' Hey Jude Released on Bowie's 1971 album Hunky Dory, Life On Mars? was not released as a single until 1973 to cash in on the success of his 1972 album Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars The song reached #3 on the UK charts and #67 in Australia In the wake of Bowie's death in 2016, the song was performed as a tribute by musicians including Rick Wakeman, Lorde, Sarah Blasko, Coldplay, Sinead O'Connor, and Aurora, as well as a church organ version from St Alban's Cathedral in the UK that went viral

Musically, both songs have a bass line that steps down a semi-tone through the verse, although Life On Mars? flips this idea in different ways by changing keys and going up in semi-tones in the pre-chorus.

Bowie even acknowledged the ""revenge trip"" in his own oblique way on the back of the Hunky Dory album — next to the tracklisting for Life On Mars? a handwritten scrawl reads ""Inspired by Frankie"".

'It's the freakiest show…'

The song was recorded in August 1971, with the core musicians being future members of Bowie's famed Spiders Of Mars line-up — Mick Ronson on guitar (he also wrote the string parts), Trevor Bolder on bass, and Mick 'Woody' Woodmansey on drums.

On piano was Rick Wakeman, who recorded his parts on the same piano The Beatles used to record Hey Jude.

Wakeman would go on to be a key member of prog-rock band Yes, and the piano would go on to feature on Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and numerous Queen albums (although not Bohemian Rhapsody, despite what some people on the internet claim).

Two days after Bowie's death, Wakeman appeared on BBC Radio 2 to perform an instrumental version of the song and recollect its recording.

""I remember leaving [the studio] and saying to a couple of friends that I met that evening in a local pub that I'd just played on the best song that I'd ever had the privilege to work on,"" Wakeman said.

""It had every single ingredient.

""The great thing about David was he was a wonderful melody man, but it wasn't just the melodies — he had great ideas for chord structures and would always throw in the odd surprise when you were least expecting it.""

'The film is saddening bore…'

Interpreting those complex chords and melodies are a challenge for any musician, but it was one that had to be tackled by a unique tribute band called The Thin White Ukes — a ukulele trio led by music journalist Michael Dwyer.

""It's a really sophisticated song musically,"" Dwyer said.

""It was one of the most challenging things we've ever done and we put it off for a really long time because it's perfection as it's recorded.

""[But we were] aware that when people come to see a David Bowie tribute that it's one of the songs that they expect to hear.""

But it's the lyrics — ""a gloriously strange sci-fi anthem"" as one writer put it — that really spoke to Dwyer as a young man.

He said the title is a great metaphor, hinting at the remainder of an unasked question — ""is there life on Mars, because there sure as hell isn't any down here?"".

""The thing I identify with, and I think so many people identified with Bowie originally, was he was a very normal kid in a dead-end middle-class life who dared to dream,"" Dwyer said.

""I was that kind of desperate suburban kid going to the movies and thinking, 'Is this the best you've got? Surely life is more than this. Please tell me there's something more than this'.

"" It kind of sounds glib, but Bowie showed so many of our generation that you could transcend — that you were kind of limitless and glittering and immortal if you wanted to be. ""

'She walks through a sunken dream…'

Something For Kate frontman Paul Dempsey has also added the song to his solo setlist, in part because ""it's an astounding song"" but also as a way to test himself.

""That note he hits in the chorus when he sings 'Life on Mars' … for me to get up there is … really pushing myself,"" he laughed.

""It's one of those songs that's just so grand in scale and intimidating in its orchestration and complexity, and they're the types of songs that I try and cover by myself with an acoustic guitar because they really present a challenge.""

Dempsey remembered being ""swept away by the strings"" when hearing the song as a kid, and later being impressed by the combination of the electric guitar solo with the orchestra.

But the song is now linked to Dempsey's memories of seeing it performed every night as part of Bowie's 2004 tour of Australia, for which Something For Kate was the opening band.

David Bowie died at the age of 69 in 2016, and is considered to be one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. (Supplied)

""The version he did [on that tour] was just him and [pianist] Mike Garson … so it was really stripped back, almost a slightly cabaret version of the song, and it was just stunning,"" Dempsey said.

""I think my strongest memories of the tour are actually just the soundchecks when everyone was relaxed and hanging out and chatting, and David himself was just so friendly and welcoming to us.

""We didn't expect that … we didn't even expect necessarily that we'd get to meet him. But he was so friendly … he was so normal.

""So you're just kind of chatting away with this lovely, nice person, and it's not quite clicking, who you're talking to, and then it's only 20 minutes later, you kind of go, 'Shit, I was just talking to David Bowie'.""

'But her friend is nowhere to be seen…'

When Bowie died in 2016, Dempsey could not bring himself to listen to any of Bowie's music — least of all the Blackstar album, which came out just two days before Bowie's death and is viewed as his farewell gift to fans.

For fellow singer-songwriter Sarah Blasko, there was no avoiding Bowie's music. In the days following his death, she was approached by triple j to perform a tribute to the legendary artist.

""I was really honoured to do that [but] it was a difficult decision of what David Bowie song I was going to do,"" Blasko said, admitting the choice ""caused a slight amount of panic"".

She said she tried Heroes and a couple of others, but it was Life On Mars? that ""hit the spot"".

""[It] seemed to resonate the most and it felt like it made sense with how I was feeling in response to him passing away as well,"" Blasko said.

""It has this sense of hopefulness and hopelessness at the same time, of asking that question 'Is there something more?'.

"" It's uplifting and there's humour to it, but it's kind of sombre and sad as well. ""

Blasko said she was ""a little bit baffled"" as to why triple j had asked her to perform the tribute because she was ""a little old"" for that national youth broadcaster's audience but took it as ""a big compliment"".

""I think I must have often referenced him as an influence,"" she said.

""I'd often talk about 'the Davids' — David Byrne and David Bowie — as being huge influences in terms of performance and putting a lot of thought and effort into strong visuals and being creative with pop music.

""David Bowie was one of the first singers I really remember sitting up and listening to as a kid.""

Fashion! - David Bowie in action in 1987 (Fashion! David Bowie in 1987)

Blasko, like Dempsey, is renowned for being a great interpreter of other people's songs — check out her covers of Cold Chisel's Flame Trees or Crowded House's Don't Dream It's Over — but her triple j performance of Life On Mars?, less than a week after Bowie's death, hit her differently.

""I found it very hard to perform and to sing because I was really emotional,"" she explained.

""My partner and I are both huge fans — we felt like we were in mourning, even though we didn't know the guy.

""There's a very long-held note in there that's just on the edge of my range, so it was challenging to sing, but I was fuelled by my emotions, which enabled me to go for it.""

'He's in the best-selling show…'

Life On Mars? was not a single upon its release and its parent album Hunky Dory bombed, strengthening the notion at the time that Bowie was a one-hit wonder thanks to his 1969 single Space Oddity.

But Bowie did not care. By the time Hunky Dory was released, he had already begun morphing into a new version of himself — dubbed Ziggy Stardust.

The subsequent album — The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars — made Bowie a star, and its success helped drag Hunky Dory and Life On Mars? into the spotlight.

Nearly a year after its release, Hunky Dory finally cracked the UK charts reaching #3. The following year, Life On Mars? would finally get a single release to coincide with a compilation album and reached #3 in the UK.

Its belated recognition has highlighted the song's significance in terms of Bowie's career, showcasing his growing talents, confidence and ambition as a vocalist, songwriter and artist.

Drummer Mick 'Woody' Woodmansey told British music mag NME after Bowie's death that Life On Mars? ""Was the first time we realised what his calibre of writing could go to"".

""It had just gone to another level of quality,"" Woodmansey said.

""That one was like 'This was terrific' — it was something special.

"" But at the same time, it was a bit scary because there was nothing around like that. There was nobody anywhere near with that kind of direction or style or anything. ""

Life On Mars? would chart in the UK again in 2007 and 2013 and, when Bowie died in 2016, it was the second-highest charting of the 13 songs that re-entered charts, reaching #16, just behind Heroes.

Like Sarah Blasko, it seems large numbers of people felt like it was the perfect song to help them deal with the death of an icon.

"ARIA Award nominations 2025: Ninajirachi, Dom Dolla, Amyl & The Sniffers lead the pack Nominations for the 39th annual ARIA Awards have been revealed, with a host of Australian musicians and artists in the running to take home a pointy trophy.

With 29 categories spanning multiple genres and disciplines, it once again reflects the strength and diversity of the local industry over the past year.

Who’s got the most ARIA nominations?

Leading the nominees, with a whopping eight nods, is Central Coast producer Ninajirachi. Her debut album I Love My Computer is vying in major categories like Album of the Year, Best Solo Artist, Best Independent and Electronic Release.

A two-time triple j Unearthed High finalist, Nina Wilson has been making music since she was 12 years old. She brands her sound as ""girl EDM""— a playful update on the 2010s electronic dance music genre dominated by men.

We hailed I Love My Computer as an ""instant classic that rewires nostalgia into a deliriously fun, addictive, innovative rush of rave-ready electro-pop"".

NInajirachi's full-length debut is among August's best albums Photo shows Ninajirachi by Tom Vanderzeil [Lead] In a massive month of new releases, these were 10 highlights we played over and over.

Just behind Ninajirachi is Dom Dolla, with seven nominations. An ARIA favourite, the globally revered DJ and producer is in the running for Best Solo Artist, Best Australian Live Act, Best Video, Song of the Year, Best Engineer and Producer, and is the one to beat for Best Dance/Electronic Release – the category he’s conquered three times before.

Amyl and the Sniffers have six nominations, making a strong return to the ARIAs from the Melbourne pub-punks. After taking two ARIA wins in 2022, the enigmatic, electric band have torn across the globe including performances at Glastonbury, Coachella and Reading & Leeds festivals.

With their third album Cartoon Darkness under their belts, Amyl and The Sniffers have now matched their previous ARIAs nominations record. This year they’re vying to take home the pointy award for Best Australian Live Act, Best Group, Best Rock Album, Best Video, Best Video, Best Cover Art and the coveted Album of the Year.

Who else is hoping for ARIAs glory?

Next up, each securing five nominations, is Hilltop Hoods and Thelma Plum.

The former trailblazing Adelaide hip hop trio are contenders for Best Group, Best Australian Live Act and Best Hip Hop/Rap Release for their chart-topping ninth album Fall From The Light, looking to add to their 10 previous ARIA trophies.

Gamilaraay singer-songwriter Thelma Plum is competing for Best Solo Artist, Album of the Year, and Best Pop Release behind second album I’m Sorry, Now Say It Back. She’s only won one ARIA previously: Best Cover Art back in 2019.

It’s a four-way tie for those in competition to take home four ARIA awards each. Vibe-setting electronic trio RÜFÜS DU SOL (who will be in town on their huge homecoming tour), beloved songwriter (and #4 in the Hottest 100 of Australian Songs), Missy Higgins, Like A Version-dominating duo Royel Otis, and Folk Bitch Trio, an emerging group known for their breathtaking vocal harmonies.

Squaring off in the newly minted Best Music Festival category is Dylan Alcott’s all-inclusive Ability Fest; Victorian NYE event Beyond the Valley; NSW coastal favourites Yours and Owls and controversial Bluesfest, plus, summer touring staple Laneway Festival (fresh from dropping a 2026 line-up topped by Chappell Roan).

Australian rock and roll luminaries You Am I are being inducted into the Hall of Fame, joining icons including Yothu Yindi, Kylie Minogue, John Farnham and last year’s inductee Missy Higgins.

""We are bemused, flattered and surprised to be asked to sit at the parents’ table,"" frontman Tim Rogers joked of the induction.

The winners will be revealed on Wednesday, November 19 at the ARIA Awards ceremony, hosted at Sydney’s Hordern Pavilion on Gadigal Land.

"Kevin Bacon on the importance of music, philanthropy and acting Kevin Bacon sings to his goats.

Scroll through his Instagram and you'll spot him belting out Chappell Roan's Hot To Go on the Connecticut farm he shares with wife and fellow actor Kyra Sedgewick. Or he'll pull you out of the Monday blues, raving about his favourite albums and songs with an infectious enthusiasm.

I saw him one day as I was scrolling and thought, ""Damn. I've got to get Kevin Bacon to Take 5.""

Loading Instagram content

Kevin has been omnipresent on screen for more than 40 years. From Footloose to A Few Good Men, JFK to The River Wild, his ability to step into the shoes of just about any character has made him one of the most prolific actors on the planet.

But it wasn't his first love. ""Before I even knew what acting was, I knew that if I walked into a room of people, I wanted them to look at me. I loved the idea of pop stardom.""

Watch Take 5 with Zan Rowe Photo shows Kevin Bacon gestures over a record player manned by Take 5 host Zan Rowe in a recording studio Across six episodes, icons in music and screen join Double J host Zan Rowe to delve deep into intimate moments in their lives as they share five songs they love.

A musical upbringing

Kevin was drawn to percussion, hitting the drum kit in his childhood Philadelphia basement until, at age 13, he joined a band at the local community centre.

Their name? Footloose.

""It's pretty weird, right?"" the 67-year-old smiles, sitting across from me in a recording studio in New York City. ""Strangely prophetic.""

Shortly afterward, his big brother Michael tapped him to play drums in his band. Michael is nine years Kevin's senior; he'd hand down albums and be out gigging as Kevin was growing up.

"" He was the musician in the family. I think my mother felt like, 'You should do something else. Let Michael do the music.' ""

But Michael had other ideas. In 1995, the same year Kevin starred in Apollo 13, his big brother asked him to form a new band, The Bacon Brothers, with the two of them both out front.

Kevin had never played guitar, but Michael wasn't having it.

""To stand up there and take our songs … and play and sing in front of people, it was a terrifying proposition. The first show that I did, my knees were literally knocking. That's one of the few times I've experienced that.""

They've now been playing and releasing records for 30 years.

Around their inception in the mid-90s, some college students in the US came up with a parlour game: Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.

He'd worked with so many people; could he be connected to any actor in six steps or less?

""I hated it,"" Kevin tells me. ""I thought it was a joke at my expense. You know what I mean? Here's a loser. Here's a great actor. Can you believe that me, down here, can be connected to this?""

But a decade or so later, he embraced it and — letting go of some ego — realised it could be harnessed to do good.

""When I came to New York, and all through my twenties and most of my thirties, I'd say I was really focused on me. That was the driving force … for me to get a part, for me to make some money, for me to get girls.""

Giving back to others

""After I had children, I started to step outside of myself. And when I started to just step outside of myself a little bit, and read the paper, I would get overwhelmed by whatever it was: the environment or hunger or injustice or animals. Now it's time for me to give a little bit back to the world.""

Kevin Bacon's Take 5 songs: Earth, Wind & Fire – Happy Feeling, 1975 Spin Doctors – Little Miss Can't Be Wrong, 1991 John Prine & Iris DeMent – In Spite of Ourselves, 1999 Frank Ocean – Thinkin Bout You, 2012 Brandi Carlile – The Joke, 2018

Reclaiming the party game name, he set up SixDegrees.org in 2007, a non-profit organisation that connected community groups to funding and amplified their voices.

They've just opened Ruth's Room, named for his late mother, who committed her life to grassroots charities.

In a juvenile justice centre in Philadelphia, Ruth's Room is a place where detained kids can learn and make music, be creative and feel safe.

Connection and empathy run deep in the Bacon family.

""If you want to be an actor, it's about empathising or being compassionate to all forms of human nature,"" he says.

""You have to be empathetic and have compassion for the characters that you're going to play, even when they've done terrible things.""

It's his ability to walk in another's shoes — in his professional and philanthropic life — that reveals itself as he shares his songs of joy.

Music runs deep, too. The family group chat often features a lot of songs being passed around.

He and his wife are parents to actor-daughter Sosie and musician-son Travis. It makes sense.

The Joke, a soaring hit from US country singer Brandi Carlile, caps off our Take 5.

""Kyra played it for me and said, 'You got to listen to this.' And we sat there together, and she was like, 'Wait for it. Wait for it.' And it just hit so hard.""

He peers into the distance as Carlile hits the incredible final note. ""The way that she sings, it's like a primal scream. When an artist is showing the fight or energy or hopefulness, it always is a little bit of respite.""

I ask Kevin if joy is an act of rebellion.

""I think that people are cashing in on a lot of despair and feeling overwhelmed. And if you're able to find some kind of peace and some kind of joy in such a chaotic and sometimes backward-seeming world, country, situation…

""If you can find joy, it is a little bit of an F-U to the despair.""

"'Turning it up to eleven': Spinal Tap returns ""There's a fine line between clever and stupid."" — Nigel Tufnel, This Is Spinal Tap.

I first encountered Spinal Tap at the age of nine, when they appeared in a season three episode of The Simpsons.

As a kid already immersed in the thunder of Metallica, Motörhead, Megadeth, and Black Sabbath, this oddball British heavy metal band instantly caught my attention.

They looked and sounded like the real deal, yet something was hilariously off.

Mispronounced town names, malfunctioning stage props, and petty squabbles revealed a new way to rock and one that was brilliantly funny.

Three decades later, I never imagined I'd be sitting down with the legendary band themselves to talk about what it means to rock 'n' roll in 2025.

A cult classic is born

When This Is Spinal Tap premiered in 1984 (and reached Australian cinemas in 1985), audiences didn't quite know what to make of it.

The film not only coined the term mockumentary but went on to influence generations of comedy, eventually earning a place in the US National Film Registry and, most recently, a 4K restoration.

Directed by Rob Reiner in his feature debut and co-written with Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer, the project was a collaborative triumph.

Guest, McKean, and Shearer inhabited the hapless rockers on screen, while Reiner appeared as documentary filmmaker Martin ""Marty"" Di Bergi, chronicling their ill-fated American tour.

Together, they crafted a razor-sharp send-up of rock star excess and the overly reverent music documentaries of the late 70s.

From modest release to cult phenomenon

Though critically lauded, the film's theatrical run was only a modest success. It was the VHS release that transformed it into a cult classic.

That's when I finally connected the dots between the cartoon cameo and the full-length feature.

The quote-ability was irresistible: amps that ""go to eleven,"" a disastrously undersized Stonehenge stage prop, and a string of doomed drummers.

Its satire was so pitch-perfect that, according to legend, Ozzy Osbourne believed it to be a genuine documentary on first viewing.

Can Tap still hit the right note?

Now, 41 years later, the band is back with Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, following the group as they reunite for one last, contractually obligated performance.

But does a phenomenon born in the analogue age resonate in 2025 when comedy is consumed in TikTok-sized bursts?

Speaking with ""Marty"" via video call, he was quick to point out the film's influence.

Without This Is Spinal Tap, he argued, there would be no The Office, Modern Family, or the countless other mockumentaries that have shaped modern television comedy.

As for whether the new film has prompted the band to reflect on their legacy, their answer was characteristically blunt: ""No.""

Yet spending time with them ahead of the release, one thing was abundantly clear.

The years may have passed, but to borrow from another iconic British rock act, the song remains the same.

"Australian-born singer drops out of Russian-hosted Intervision song contest after 'political pressure' An Australian-born singer representing the United States at the Russian-hosted Intervision song contest has dropped out at the last minute after what organisers claimed was political pressure from the Australian government.

Vasiliki Karagiorgos, known professionally as ""Vassy"", was slated to represent the US on Saturday in the Soviet-era song contest in Moscow, which was revived this year at the decree of President Vladimir Putin after Russia was banned from Eurovision due to the war in Ukraine.

But the Australian singer and producer, who was set to perform in the fifth slot, dropped out after coming under what Russian organisers said was ""unprecedented political pressure from the government of Australia"".

The singer told the ABC in a statement that she had left Moscow and was ""still in shock"", adding she was reluctant to give further details until she spoke with the Australian government.

""For now, I'll take the time to process everything,"" she said.

""While it's heartbreaking for the fans and the music that I had to withdraw, I want to ensure I'm doing the right thing and following proper guidance.""

The Australian government has had ""no engagement"" with the Intervision song contest, a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told the ABC.

However, the spokesperson did not comment specifically on Vassy's case.

In 2022, Australia placed sanctions on the main sponsor of the song contest, Russian majority state-owned bank VTB.

Born in Darwin to Greek immigrant parents, Vassy moved to the US in the 2010s, becoming the first Australian artist to hit number one on Billboard's Dance Club Songs chart with the track We Are Young.

She returned to Australia in 2022.

In 2023, Vassy became the first woman to win an Icon trophy at the Electronic Dance Music Awards in Miami.

Vietnam crowned the winner

This year's Intervision song contest, which featured acts aimed at promoting ""traditional family values"", attracted singers from 23 countries, accounting for more than half the world's population, including China, India and Brazil.

Vietnam's Duc Phuc was crowned the winner in the early hours of Sunday morning by a jury of representatives from each participating country, scoring a cash prize of 30 million roubles ($546,000).

Kyrgyzstan was awarded second place while Qatar came third.

All songs were performed in national languages.

Russia's own entrant — Shaman, whose real name is Yaroslav Dronov — asked the jury to disregard his performance due to Moscow being the host.

The show was broadcast live on Russian television, with organisers saying it was also broadcast over the internet or on TV in other countries with a combined population of more than 4 billion people.

Aside from a duo of Russian-language presenters, the presenting team included a female Indian presenter speaking in English and a Chinese male presenter speaking in Mandarin.

Mr Putin opened the final with a video statement, saying the world was changing fast and wishing the contestants good luck.

Organisers said Saudi Arabia had agreed to host the contest next year.

"From Jennifer Lopez to K-pop, meet the Australian backing artists helping superstars shine It would be a mistake to assume sisters Vika and Linda Bull have been left feeling overshadowed by their years spent onstage as backing vocalists.

For almost four decades, the musical duo has been singing their soulful harmonies alongside Australia's best-known acts, their unmistakable voices appearing on albums that range from Paul Kelly and Kasey Chambers to Ross Wilson and John Farnham.

""There's never been a frustration being a backing singer — not for me,"" says Vika.

Also sharing the stage, and spotlight, with some of music's biggest names are Queensland dancers Kira Stray and Danica McKenzie.

Backing artists like Kira and Danica and the Bull sisters spend years perfecting their craft, often in the shadows.

But who are these artists and how does it feel supporting the star of the show?

Dancing with JLo

Ever since she was a little girl, Kira Stray dreamed of touring as a backup dancer.

""People would ask me, 'What do you want to do when you're older?' [and I'd say], 'I just want to tour with an artist and then once I've done that, I can just die happy',"" she says.

Kira says finding out she would be dancing with JLo was ""the best feeling in the world"". (Supplied: Katriena Emmanuel)

Yet the Gold Coast dancer did not expect it to happen so quickly and in such spectacular fashion.

""I had been flying in and out of the states for training since I was 16 years old,"" Kira says.

There was a subsequent move to Toronto to be closer to the US and eventually the securing of an American visa.

Then, within a week of moving to LA, the 25-year-old received a message from a choreographer inviting her to a ""skeleton"", the dance term for a choreography workshop.

""I had only been in the States for about a week, and the night before [the workshop] started, I was added to a group chat titled 'JLo's Tour'.

""I had a heart attack. Little did I know that was actually my audition week. I was on watch that whole week.""

Three weeks later, Kira found out she would be dancing with the superstar.

Kira (second from bottom) has just returned from an almost two-month-long tour of Europe. (Supplied)

""It was honestly the best feeling in the world,"" she says.

Since April, Kira's life has been a whirlwind of performances. An appearance at the Saudi Arabian leg of the Formula 1 Grand Prix was followed by a performance at the American Music Awards, before a stop at World Pride in Washington. Then there was a two-month-long tour of Europe.

In between performances with JLo, Kira found time to dance with other acts, including an appearance at Coachella with Bebe Rexha. But an offer to tour with j-hope from BTS was put on ice after injuring herself on the eve of the tour.

A former backup performer herself, JLo is a dancer's dancer, and her twelve-strong troupe are among the best in the industry.

""We have quite a big team on the road with us and then of course, there's all of the crew, the band, the backing vocalists. We all just become like one big family to be honest, it's pretty special,"" Kira says.

""I think that's the best part about it. Of course, the shows, the fans, the arenas, the stadiums and the travel is amazing, but getting to do it with a good group of people just makes it 10 times better.

""And obviously under such an incredible boss. She really is one of the best, most hard-working, humble humans I've ever met.""

Songstress sisters

Vika and Linda grew up listening to the Tongan Choir — ""massive singers with beautiful harmonies"" according to Vika — and performed together for the first time in church.

As adults, they eventually formed their own band called The Honeymooners, but it was short-lived as soon after they were asked to audition for Joe Camilleri's The Black Sorrows.

Linda knew it was an opportunity that would be ""stupid to say no to"" and while it was a ""step sideways for them"", it would also be a learning experience.

""The band had such a great reputation, and they had enormous experience collectively as a group,"" she says.

Time with The Black Sorrows solidified the sisters' reputation for beautiful harmonies.

Touring and performing with Paul Kelly followed soon after, as did the chance to sing on the Archie Roach album Charcoal Lane. They even enjoyed a lengthy stint performing with the RocKwiz Orkestra for the SBS show RocKwiz.

""Being a backup singer is such a great job, it's constantly changing, nothing's ever the same,"" says Linda.

But it was singing in John Farnham's Chain Reaction choir, where they would meet a backing singer with an astounding artist list to her name, that cemented their love for what they do.

Venetta Fields began her career in the 60s as a session vocalist for Ike and Tina Turner. Thanks to her formidable vocals, she went on to sing with a who's who of music — The Rolling Stones, Diana Ross, Barbra Streisand, Pink Floyd, Bob Dylan, Joe Cocker and even the late great Aretha Franklin — before later moving to Australia.

""She quickly whipped us into shape,"" says Linda of the legendary backing singer.

""If we hadn't had her expert mentoring … we would have been a little bit slower on the uptake.""

K-pop dream hunter

Danica McKenzie was in Brisbane teaching dance and performing for the Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast Titans when she was offered the opportunity to be part of a dance reality TV show in South Korea.

""We don't get a lot of these jobs coming through [to Brisbane], they normally go straight to Sydney or Melbourne,"" says Danica.

Despite the rigours of performing alongside dancers famous for their elaborate and technical K-pop routines, Danica — who is currently travelling the country on a concert tour of the show — is ""very happy"" to be in South Korea.

""One thing I really love about it here is that they really … respect dancers,"" she says.

""We're also getting some interest from K-pop stars.""

A self-described freelancer — an agent typically represents dancers — Danica relies on social media to promote herself.

""Most jobs, if not all, I've gotten through Instagram or I've been asked to send my Instagram through so they can see what I've done.""

Testament to the potential for social media to help launch a career, a TikTok video by Danica has gone viral, attracting a staggering 16 million views. Yet she has mixed feelings about social media's role in dance.

""I do think [social media] is fantastic and it works for a lot of people, but I also think it's a bit of a downfall because it can put a lot of extra stress and pressure [on] to constantly be creating or constantly putting out good stuff.""

But despite the demands of her career, Danica says it makes her feel ""alive and happy"".

'Enormously rewarding career'

The Bull sisters have a new album coming out next year but there is still nothing more joyous than performing as part of a team.

According to Linda, the sisters have had an ""enormously rewarding career"".

""[Some] singers think, 'I've never made it, I'm just a backing singer.' Don't say that. It disrespects the job,"" she says.

"Pink Floyd's album and ode to Syd Barrett Wish You Were Here turns 50 The problem with creating an incredible work of art is that you're expected to do it again and again.

This was issue facing English rock band Pink Floyd in the wake of their massive 1973 album The Dark Side Of The Moon, which had suddenly made them the biggest band in the world.

Grappling with their new-found global fame, they began the slow, laborious process of making what would become Wish You Were Here — a record that simultaneously attacked the very industry that had made them stars, while honouring a man who'd helped them get there.

That man — the band's mercurial former frontman Syd Barrett, from whom they had recently split — would add to the growing mythos around Pink Floyd by making a strange visit to the studio during the making of Wish You Were Here, which was released 50 years ago this week.

Have a cigar, you're gonna go far

The story of Wish You Were Here, and indeed the story of Pink Floyd, begins with Barrett.

A uniquely talented songwriter and inventive guitarist, Barrett led Pink Floyd as it burst out of Cambridge in the mid-60s, penning most of the band's lauded debut album The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, released August 1967.

Less than 12 months later, Barrett's erratic behaviour — fuelled by a combination of LSD and undiagnosed mental health issues — had become too much for his band mates, who made the pragmatic decision to simply not pick him up on the way to a gig one night.

A photo from the brief time when Pink Floyd was a five-piece, including both Syd Barrett and David Gilmour. (Wikipedia)

But the spectre of Barrett loomed large.

When the frontman officially parted ways with the group in March 1968, the band's management went with him, believing him to be the key creative force behind Pink Floyd.

The remaining members — Roger Waters, Nick Mason, Richard Wright and the newly added Dave Gilmour — began to forge a new direction, which would ultimately lead to the record-breaking success of The Dark Side Of The Moon in 1973.

Welcome to the machine

It's impossible to overstate how huge The Dark Side Of The Moon was (and is).

Believed to be one of only four albums to have sold more than 45 million copies worldwide, it has spent a record 990 weeks, the equivalent of about 19 years, in the US Billboard top 200 albums chart.

Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon album cover, designed by Storm Thorgerson, 1973.

Upon release, Dark Side's success brought Pink Floyd success beyond its wildest dreams. Suddenly they were millionaires with country manors and luxury cars — ironic for a band that had sung that money was ""the root of all evil today"" on Dark Side's lead single Money.

But Dark Side's success capped off an exhausting stretch for the band.

They had released eight albums and played close to 750 shows in six years, and the added whirlwind of attention for Dark Side left them drained in new ways.

In a 2012 documentary about the making of Wish You Were Here, Waters said the band could ""easily have split up"" after Dark Side, but didn't because they were each too afraid to exist outside the financial and creative safety of Pink Floyd.

However, guitarist Gilmour said the period after Dark Side was an important moment of self-reflection.

""We were all having to assess what we were in this business for, why we were doing it, whether we were artists or business people,"" Gilmour said.

""Having achieved the sort of success and money … that could fulfil anyone's wildest teenage dreams, why we would still want to continue to do it?""

The band spent long, often fruitless periods in a rehearsal room, occasionally touring, and frequently feeling they were getting nowhere.

In the studio they were equally listless, spending whole days drinking, playing squash or shooting at a dartboard with an air rifle, recording in fits and starts between bouts of rumination and argument.

Roger Waters was behind the underlying themes of Wish You Were Here. (Supplied: Sony)

But out of this soul-searching, two clear ideas emerged, directed largely by Waters: a distaste for the record industry vultures who had preyed on their success, and a yearning for their friend and former band mate Syd Barrett, who had been chewed up and spat out by ""rock'n'roll"" and the drug-fuelled lifestyle that came with it.

""It was felt that Syd's 'madness' had partly come about through the demands of the record industry,"" Gilmour said.

These two factors became the basis of Wish You Were Here.

We call it riding the gravy train

Pink Floyd's feelings about the music industry are best exemplified by the tracks Welcome To The Machine and Have A Cigar.

The former is an ominous-sounding song about a musician who graduates from ""the pipeline"" into ""the machine"", and achieves great riches but is ""told … what to dream"".

The real venom is saved for Have A Cigar, sung from the perspective of industry fat cats by folk singer and friend of the band Roy Harper.

It features the great industry kiss-off, ""We're so happy we can hardly count"" and the real-life query often put to the band by ignorant label suits,""Oh, by the way, which one's Pink?""

But it was the songs about Barrett that provided the heart and soul of the album, and tied together its deeper theme about failing to be present as the world spins.

Shine on, you crazy diamond

After officially parting ways with Pink Floyd in early 1968, Barrett began recording a solo album.

A string of producers (including Gilmour and Waters) and session musicians found themselves befuddled by Barrett's behaviour — he wouldn't play in time, would rarely play the same thing twice, gave little to no direction to the backing musicians, and his songs and performances wavered from genius to sub-par, depending on his mental health and drug intake on the day.

The haphazard sessions were also interrupted by Barrett spending time in psychiatric care at one point.

The Madcap Laughs came out on January 2, 1970, and was quickly followed by a more polished and contained album simply called Barrett.

But after that, his music career was, for all intents and purposes, over, and he fell out of contact with his former band mates.

Gilmour noted Wish You Were Here's title track was a broader song about absence that he ""couldn't sing … without thinking about Syd"", but Shine On You Crazy Diamond was ""specifically about Syd"".

Waters called the latter his ""homage to Syd and my heartfelt expression of my sadness and admiration for [his] talent, and sadness for the loss of [my] friend"".

It refers to Barrett in many ways, all true — stranger, legend, martyr, raver, seer of visions, painter, piper, prisoner.

A 26-minute epic in nine parts, Shine On You Crazy Diamond bookended the album — the first half featuring the bulk of the lyrics and a now-famous four-note arpeggio known as ""Syd's Theme"", and the last half ending with a reference to the Barrett-era single See Emily Play.

It was during the mixing of this massive song — revered as one of Pink Floyd's greatest moments — that Barrett turned up unannounced at Abbey Road Studios.

Barrett was unrecognisable. He had gained weight and shaved off his eyebrows and hair, and according to Wright, it took more than half an hour before anyone figured out who he was.

""In those days it was quite normal for strangers to wander into our sessions,"" Wright told Mojo magazine in 1994.

""This guy kept on getting up and brushing his teeth and then sitting, doing really weird things, but keeping quiet.""

When they finally figured out it was Barrett, the band members were in shock.

Waters and Gilmour wept to see their once vivacious livewire of a frontman as a shell of himself, who didn't seem to fully comprehend where he was or what was happening.

That he had wandered into the studio while the band was working on a song about him added to the absurd and sad nature of the scene.

Barrett was invited to stay at the conclusion of the session for a celebration of Gilmour's recent wedding, but he left soon after and his band mates never saw him again.

Barrett died in 2006, having effectively withdrawn from society after moving back into his mother's house in Cambridge in 1978.

How I wish you were here

Wish You Were Here was always going to fall short of its once-in-a-lifetime predecessor, The Dark Side Of The Moon, but it was still huge, hitting number one around the world, and cementing Pink Floyd as the biggest band on the planet.

It has sold more than 20 million copies globally, and appears in countless top album lists, alongside Pink Floyd's other big albums Dark Side, The Wall, and their influential psychedelic debut The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn.

From its iconic artwork of a businessman shaking hands with an on-fire counterpart (achieved by setting a stuntsman aflame about 15 times) to its mix of ideas around absence and loss in an increasingly corporate society, Wish You Were Here summed up where the band was at in the mid-70s.

"RONA. weaves together country, colonialism and club music on new EP It's All Here The experiences of First Nations people are rarely centred in electronic music. Rona Glynn-McDonald is changing that.

Under the mononym RONA., the Kaytetye DJ and producer blends her connection to a 65,000-year-old storytelling tradition with the thump of club and house music.

Her tunes evoke both urban dancefloors and sprawling desert landscapes, with the sampled sounds of country woven alongside nods to Indigenous history and resistance.

Case in point: Her breakout debut set for music tastemakers Boiler Room in January 2024 interlaced throbbing bangers with a 1982 rallying speech from Gumbaynggirr activist Uncle Gary Foley.

It was a defining moment. Not just because RONA.'s selections earned glowing praise from ravers, and nearly 50,000 YouTube views, but because she knew it was a ""huge opportunity"" to represent the First Nations experience. As she told triple j last year:

"" I didn't want to just do a good job. I wanted to show up with strength of storytelling that builds upon generations and decades of resistance. ""

Indigenous peoples' struggles, much like songlines, are connected through generations.

""We want justice, we want land rights. 1788, 1982, today, the message remains the same,"" RONA. wrote on TikTok following the ""emotional, powerful"" performance, where she also brought red dirt and Tjoritja seeds from her home for good luck.

From bush to big city and back again

RONA. has split her time living between Naarm (Melbourne) and Mparntwe (Alice Springs).

""My Nana always laughs that I keep Qantas in the air because of all the flights I take,"" the 29-year-old tells Double J's Karen Leng.

RONA. is originally from Imangara, ""which is on a station called Murray Downs"" on Kaytetye country.

""It's expansive blue skies; the birds are chirping. There is scrub all around … across a low-lying hill. That's where my great, great, great grandfather comes from.""

A ""few generations"" of her family also hail from Mparntwe on Arrernte country, ""which is the beautiful Caterpillar Dreaming"" — common local knowledge concerning giant ancestral caterpillars that formed the striking mountainous landscape.

It was not until she relocated to Naarm/Melbourne at age 17, to study economics and finance, that RONA. realised that most Australians had very little connection to First Nations culture, let alone country.

""My music sounds different based on where I'm writing."" RONA. on Arrernte Country.

As a Melbourne University student, she helped close the gap on Indigenous culture and stories through non-profit organisations.

Firstly, as the founding CEO of online resource Common Ground and later, the director of funding platform First Nations Futures. Her community work earned a spot in Forbes Asia's 30 under 30 and briefly saw her following in her family's footsteps.

Rona's father is acclaimed director Warwick Thornton (Samson and Delilah, Sweet Country, Mystery Road) and her grandmother is Freda Glynn, the trailblazing co-founder of the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA), the first Aboriginal-owned radio and television station.

RONA. has fast become a festival booker's favourite, at events like Laneway, Pitch, Strawberry Fields, Sonder, and this December's Meredith Music Festival. (Supplied: Bananas Clarke)

After curating short films, documentaries, and recording mindful Dreamtime stories for Common Ground, RONA.'s love of storytelling took her to a different medium: songlines.

Her debut single, 2022's Closure, caught the ears of Double J while the song's clip earned an Australia Music Video of the Year nomination from triple j and rage.

Featuring Eastern Arrernte knowledge shared by custodian Helena Buzzacott, the track's blend of meditative atmosphere and hypnotic beats established a musical template.

A model RONA. is expanding upon for her upcoming EP, It's All Here. The title nods to the wisdom and knowledge that can be drawn from country and community.

Sonic sovereignty

It's All Here is also a pointed response to the ""contemporary and colonial race to space"", where the likes of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Katy Perry are rocketing off-planet.

The sci-fi themed video for new single Mars imagines Indigenous people remaining to renew a world left behind to a soundtrack of nocturnal synths and pulsing electronica.

""When all these whitefellas want to be going up into the sky to colonise other planets, we need to sit down, slow down and turn inward to the knowledge that our ancestors hold.""

Loading TikTok content

""I think that slowing down is where we find all the answers about the future.""

RONA. has taken her own advice, moving back permanently to Mparntwe after ""trying to live this dual life for so long"".

"" The juxtaposition of the city rat race and then going home to the stillness and expansive blue skies on country. ""

Her life in Naarm has been ""pretty turbo"", a decade-long marathon of ""doing all this advocacy and change-making work"" while establishing her music career.

She is not complaining. The big smoke's thriving nightlife shaped her techno heaters Raise It and Burn It, a fiery rebuttal to colonial systems released a year on from the failed Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum.

Naarm is also where RONA. met her partner, popular presenter Tony Armstrong.

The power couple made their relationship public in late 2023 and have been a media fixture since, from the Logies Red Carpet to magazine cover shoots and TV appearances.

However, settling back down in Mparntwe makes the most sense now because ""the kinds of stories I want to tell come from my home, my community and where I'm most connected"", RONA. explains.

""I don't want to be turbo anymore, I want to write from stillness and from a healed place, a slow place. A place where I feel really regenerated.

""I'm keen to spend time with my old people and elders, family and community and just sit on country.""

Re-imaging First Nation futures

The influence of Kaytetye country and her ancestors informed Show Me, the first EP track completed during a writing desert retreat where RONA. felt at a creative crossroads.

""I was thinking a lot about futures … and what it might look like in terms of our liberation as Blackfellas. I wanted to lean in and listen to my ancestors and old people in order to lead the way.""

The sense of uncertainty is captured in the track's layered, blurred vocal samples. ""You can hear the confusion of a young person sitting there going, 'which way do I go?'

"" Where do we go next as young people, as humanity. Using the tools of Afrofuturism and Blak futurism to start exploring how we re-imagine the future? ""

Set in the same visual universe as Mars, Show Me's disorienting vocals are grounded in rumbling bass, spacious textures and echoing clapsticks RONA. fashioned herself from mulga wood.

""Clapsticks is the closest instrument that Kaytetye people and my family have authority to use in music,"" she says of the instrument, which forms a percussive thread on the EP.

""It feels really special to be on country and then make something that you use in the track in the rhythm it was intended.""

She also stitched in field recordings of bird song. ""I opened up the doors of this house and I sung and the birds responded. I just stuck a mic[rophone] literally out the window.""

Running at six tracks, It's All Here contains ""wildly different"" moods — interstellar soundscapes, electro-funk rhythms, progressive house.

""But they all have this through line of being me, and I think you can hear the expansiveness of desert country in all of them,"" RONA. notes.

""A lot of them bring in field recordings … They're such an important way for me to be able to bring in the energy of country into a song. And sometimes you can't hear it but it's there — in the textures or hidden within a certain frequency, it doesn't have to be audible, it can just exist in it.""

"Broken Hill launches LGBTQIA+ festival Rainbow in the Outback Broken Hill was illuminated with joy and community spirit as it hosted the first-ever Rainbow in the Outback festival to celebrate queer pride in Far West New South Wales.

Along with colourful drag performances, local musical acts and markets, the event aimed to foster a safer, more supportive environment for LGBTQIA+ people in rural communities.

Lifelong Broken Hill resident Matthew McIntosh said it was essential to be able to be themself in their hometown.

""Festivals like this are really important to me because it's a time when I can embrace my weirdness without fear,"" they said.

""Breaking out of my shell a little bit with the help of festivals like this has very much helped me to do that when it's not a festival.

"" Now, just on a Friday night, I feel confident to be myself. ""

Dorian Courtisan said performing at the festival was a healing experience. (Supplied: Tanja Bruckner)

Dorian Lenoir grew up on South Australia's Yorke Peninsula and travelled to Broken Hill from Adelaide to perform — under the stage name Dorian Courtisan — at the event.

""Growing up queer in the countryside wasn't something people talked about — there weren't many older queer people that I knew, there weren't any events about that,"" they said.

""It was something I learnt to keep to myself, to see an environment that's similar to what I grew up in but where it is celebrated and everyone feels safe to be open is really healing and refreshing.""

He said queer young people were some of the most vulnerable people in the country.

""It's like the axis of evil — being isolated, having no-one around you that is like you, feeling alone,"" he said.

""It can really impact on a person's mental and physical health.

""It's vitally important that things like exist, especially in the Far West of NSW.""

Ongoing evolution

Broken Hill has been a part of Australia's queer iconography since the Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert was partially filmed there in late 1993.

In the years that followed the city took advantage of its new-found fame and launched the Broken Heel Festival, which went on a hiatus in 2024.

It is hoped Rainbow in the Outback will continue the celebration of Broken Hill's queer community and history.

"How youth orchestras foster lifelong friendships and open career pathways for musicians What do youth orchestras and kids sports have in common?

Both provide training grounds for future stars.

""I've had my entire pathway of musical training in Australia,"" says conductor, musician and arranger Benjamin Northey.

""Youth orchestras bring together the crème de la crème of musicians across the state.""

Benjamin Northey says he's had his entire career made in Australia thanks to opportunities fostered by youth orchestras. (Melbourne Youth Orchestra: David Ng)

Northey is in demand across Australia's biggest stages and over the ditch in New Zealand where he's been chief conductor of the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra since 2015.

He's stepping down at the end of this year, but there's no shortage of his involvement with major orchestras across Australia.

Northey attributes a huge part of his success to the opportunities he received while being in the Melbourne Youth Orchestra, an extracurricular activity he took back in high school.

Youth orchestras around the country are getting ready for their annual Big Busk on Saturday September 20, performing live in public spaces in Melbourne and Sydney, with other cities taking part later in the year.

We talked to Northey and other alumni about what being in a youth orchestra meant for them and their careers.

What it's like being in a youth orchestra

Youth orchestras provide young musicians the opportunity to learn instruments, form friendships and open doors to some of Australia's biggest stages. (Melbourne Youth Orchestra: Christine Tan)

Across Australia, youth orchestras have supported musicians for decades. Some draw members from state-wide networks, while others focus on local neighbourhoods.

The Melbourne Youth Orchestra (MYO) has been running since 1967. A similar organisation was started in Sydney in 1973. If you do an internet search, chances are, there's a youth orchestra organisation near you.

The outer-suburb orchestras run by mums Photo shows Four people wearing puffy micky-mouse-ears headbands, playing violins while looking at their scores on the music stands. Here's how a group of mums are ensuring kids in Sydney's outer suburbs have access to the musical opportunities they deserve.

These orchestras consist of several subgroups which cater to skill level and genre preference.

""[It's equivalent to] a state athletics championship or a junior level state league,"" Northey explains.

Northey joined MYO in the mid 1980s. He became a soloist playing the saxophone, touring all over Victoria as well as playing concerts in the US and UK.

""Every Saturday morning, my mum used to drive me down to Melbourne [for rehearsals] from Ballarat where we lived,"" he remembers.

Being part of the youth orchestra gave Northey high-level training as an ensemble player at a pivotal age.

""[I realised] I was one of those people who became really committed to doing music as a career,"" Northey says. ""It enabled me to focus on music at a much deeper and higher level.""

When he switched from being a soloist to conducting, Northey returned to MYO and worked with the next generation of musicians.

Providing equal opportunities to access music

""MYO was founded by educators who realised that music is important for people to immerse themselves in, no matter what kind of status they have,"" says Taj Aldeeb, one of ABC Classic's youngest presenters and recent graduate of MYO.

Aldeeb's family moved to Melbourne from Syria when she was 16, and music has been one of the ways she continues to connect with her old and new cultures.

""I brought with me the values and the culture that I grew up with,"" Aldeeb says. ""The more I was able to experience that here, the better I feel.""

Taj Aldeeb says being in a youth orchestra gave her the chance to perform on Melbourne's biggest stages. (Melbourne Youth Orchestra: Christine Tan)

At the age of 24 and while still studying piano at university, Aldeeb auditioned to join MYO as a percussionist, a growing interest of hers.

Before she knew it, ""I became the head of percussion,"" Aldeeb says.

""A few months in, I walked to the conductor and mentioned we didn't have a leader for the percussion section,"" Aldeeb recalls. ""He said, 'All right, you got it.'""

Musicians can join the youth orchestra for an intensive two-week program during the school holidays, or they can opt to be involved for the whole year.

However long or short their involvement, Aldeeb says ""they might get as much of an experience of developing skills, not just technically, but also community and friendships and teamwork and discipline.""

Aldeeb had to leave the orchestra when she turned 25, the general cutoff age for youth orchestras. But she will always cherish her time with the MYO, especially the opportunity to work within some of Melbourne's biggest stages.

""The mini-Taj would not have imagined that I would be performing in Hamer Hall at a young age,"" she says. ""Becoming a part of MYO made that happen.""

Opening doors to world-leading orchestras

Another youth orchestra alum, double bassist Phoebe Russell, remembers heading to Berlin at the age of 17 to play with one of the most prestigious orchestras in the world: the Berlin Philharmonic.

Musicians in youth orchestras have the chance to learn and play advanced symphonic repertoire, some requiring hundreds of people to play their parts.

""In my last couple of years at MYO, we basically played a lot of the professional repertoire that I tackle in my career every day,"" Russell says.

Russell remembers performing Ravel's Daphnis et Chloe at her last youth orchestra concert and then playing the same piece of music for her first appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic.

""I was suddenly thrown into the world of professional music making, but I felt comfortable because I'd done seven years of Melbourne Youth Music Camp,"" Russell says.

Russell has been playing the double bass since she was eight, and with her siblings she attended weekly rehearsals and summer camps.

Now 31, Russell is the principal double bassist at the Queensland Symphony Orchestra in Brisbane, where she's also in several chamber music ensembles, a soloist and a lecturer.

She remembers one conductor from her youth orchestra days in particular.

""One of my very early memories of youth music camps was working with conductor Benjamin Northey,"" she says.

They were recently reunited at a Queensland Symphony Orchestra concert Northey conducted.

Russell reflects: ""I've been playing with him since I was 10 or 11.""

The impact of Russell's time with the youth orchestra reaches far beyond the professional spheres.

""The memories of playing music with your friends when you're really young stays with you for life,"" she says.

""My brother and I often talk about music that we made together. He's not a musician anymore, but it's still such a big part of all of our lives.""

The Big Busk is happening on Saturday, September 20 in various locations across Sydney and Melbourne.

"Jimmy Barnes, Dave Faulkner among music industry voices in open letter urging ANU to keep School of Music Jimmy Barnes is among more than 40 music icons supporting an open letter to the embattled Australian National University (ANU) calling for the School of Music to be saved.

In July, the ANU announced proposed cuts to dismantle the 60-year-old institution, absorbing it into the School of Creative and Cultural Practice.

The proposed changes include axing one-on-one instrumental lessons.

They come as part of ANU's major restructuring aiming to save $250 million.

Widespread frustration with the restructuring was one of the driving factors behind the resignation of vice-chancellor Genevieve Bell last week.

'Damage Australia's cultural fabric'

Members of the newly formed School of Music Advocacy Roundtable, with the support of more than 40 industry professionals, penned an open letter to ANU chancellor Julie Bishop on September 17 calling for the decision to be reversed.

""If the proposed changes to the School of Music and the curriculum proceed, none of the students graduating will be employable as professional musicians,"" the letter said.

""The removal of one-on-one tuition and a shift away from professional standards will dismantle Canberra's music pipeline, undermine national arts leadership, and damage Australia's cultural fabric.

""The decision has serious social and economic implications.

""For students and early-career musicians, the loss of one-on-one training and clear pathways to professional work is devastating.""

Jimmy Barnes joins the chorus

Jimmy Barnes has supported calls for the ANU to reverse its proposed cuts to the School of Music. (ABC News)

Barnes supported the letter and said the School of Music was a pipeline for world-class musicians.

""I've seen how classical training and rock and roll can come together to create magic but that doesn't happen by accident. It happens because we invest in serious music education,"" he said.

""If one of our leading universities walks away from its responsibility, it sends a clear message that we don't value the next generation of musicians, and we can't let this happen.

""Music isn't just entertainment, it's an ecosystem. It supports jobs in venues big and small, it drives tourism, and it builds communities. The ANU's plans to dismantle the School of Music put all of that at risk. They need to do better.""

Music grows the economy

Hoodoo Gurus frontman Dave Faulkner, who also supported the letter, said the proposed changes would stop the School of Music from doing what it was designed to do.

""It's turning the School of Music — which is based around fostering the next generation of performers and artists — and turning it into a place for music appreciation instead,"" he said.

""It's taking away its primary role of one-on-one training of classical and jazz musicians. It's not meant just for listening and talking about music.""

Hoodoo Gurus frontman Dave Faulkner says the proposed changes to the School of Music prevent the institution achieving its purpose. (Christopher Ferguson)

Faulkner said the changes wouldn't just impact musicians.

""Music is a very important thing for Australia as a country,"" Faulkner said.

""People don't notice that, but it's happening around them all the time, and it's creating all this engine of employment and jobs.""

According to The Bass Line, Music Australia's analysis of the music industry, it generated more than $8 billion in 2023-2024.

Faulkner said the current proposed changes by the ANU were a one-size-fits-all solution that ""makes no sense at all"".

""They really have got to find another solution because that solution isn't a solution,"" he said.

""I don't know how they do it, but this isn't the way.""

Cease work order over staff safety

ANU academic accuses Julie Bishop of bullying Photo shows A woman wearing a denim jacket sitting at a desk with a microphone. Former member of the Australian National University council Liz Allen uses a Senate inquiry investigating university governance to allege Chancellor Julie Bishop harassed, bullied, and threatened her.

It comes as a cease work order was issued by the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) regarding health and safety concerns at the ANU College of Arts and Social Sciences, which the School of Music currently sits within.

NTEU ACT's division secretary, Lachlan Clohesy, said the cease work order had been issued because it had been deemed there was an imminent threat to staff in the college.

""It's extremely serious,"" he said.

According to the cease work order posted around the university campus, the restructuring process, called Renew ANU, had caused ""serious and ongoing harm"" to staff, including ""extreme mental health conditions"" which could have ""catastrophic consequences"".

Mr Clohesy said a report by an elected health and safety representative delivered to the ANU last Thursday had not been acted on.

""Since the report went in, things have got worse, not better,"" he said.

"" We want to prevent the most catastrophic consequences of psychological injury happening on campus. That's unfortunately the situation we are at. ""

The cease work order only applies to staff in the College of Arts and Social Sciences who have a psychosocial risk or psychological injury.

In a statement, ANU Chief People Officer Kate Witenden said staff safety is taken ""extremely seriously"".

""This has been, and continues to be, a very difficult time for our community,"" she said.

""If anyone in our community needs support, we have a range of health and wellbeing services available.""

"Aaron Chen talks comedy, faith, and moving to New York While his high school mates were doing homework, Aaron Chen spent weeknights driving from Sydney's northern suburbs to the CBD to perform at open mic comedy nights.

Arcade Fire's debut album played on the car stereo, and his dad Peter was in the passenger seat for each 30km journey.

Aaron was learning to drive while learning the art of stand-up comedy.

""We'd hang out in smokers' rooms. I'd get kicked out of pubs and not be allowed to perform.

""But all of it felt exciting. To know it was a thing that was possible, it was an incredible time.""

Aaron Chen was drawn to stand-up early. In primary school, he would watch the Melbourne International Comedy Festival Gala on TV and quote jokes to friends in the playground.

Aaron Chen's Take 5 songs: Arcade Fire – Neighbourhood #1 (Tunnels), 2004 Matt Berry – Take My Hand, 2009 Vampire Weekend – Jerusalem, New York, Berlin, 2019 Faye Wong – Dreams (夢中人), 1994 Kacey Musgraves – Deeper Well, 2024

From there he fell down a rabbit hole online, discovering the one-liner genius of Mitch Hedberg and chasing that same kind of offbeat brilliance.

It was online where Aaron could play and build his particular style of irreverent ""alternative"" comedy for fans just like him.

Today, Chen's YouTube channel has millions of streams, beaming into homes just like the Gala had.

'It was funny that I didn't know what I was doing'

It wasn't long until Aaron became a mainstay at MICF himself, winning their Class Clowns competition when he was 15, and a year later being a finalist in Raw Comedy.

In 2017 he debuted his first full show, and won Best Newcomer.

Around the same time Aaron started hosting an ad hoc tonight show on ABC2, Aaron Chen Tonight, an experience that threw him in the deep end.

""Creatively, it was a really exciting time, they let us do a lot of crazy stuff on TV. That was a plus.""

You gotta have faith

This whirlwind of attention ran parallel to moving out of home, far away from Asquith and into Sydney's Inner West where comedy and partying went hand in hand.

Chen was raised a churchgoing Christian but struggled to reconcile these two very different parts of his life. Faith took a back seat.

As his career was taking off, Aaron felt something was missing.

""My personal life was out of control. I didn't feel very grounded.

""So, I started becoming interested in it again, I wanted that anchor.

""It can feel pretty dizzying doing comedy, getting to the top of that and doing massive theatres. But to step away from that and have a bigger purpose beyond just being more successful was a relief.""

""It would be hard to figure out if I was still doing the best I could.""

He began travelling to the US, where no-one knew who he was, to start again. It was while in Los Angeles that he got an email asking him to audition for a show called Fisk.

""I knew it was Kitty Flanagan making it, that's already such a great start,"" he says. ""But I didn't know that she had me in mind for the role.

Despite being one of the ABC's most successful comedies of all time, Aaron's drive toward the unknown remains.

""I wanted to move to America to get better at comedy. All the comedy I'd consume on YouTube was tonight show spots.""

It was the land of opportunity. Aaron has already appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers and is filming a Netflix special this week.

Soon, he'll star in The Dink, a movie about pickleball produced by Ben Stiller.

""It's so surreal.""

Just as Aaron had his dad's support on those long drives, his wife Esther made the leap with him to move to New York City where they now live.

""She's much more outgoing than me. Esther helps me with my comedy as well, I'll run ideas by her or she'll tell me 'What you said today, that wasn't funny'"".

Despite his meteoric rise in Australia and a career at the tipping point in the US, Aaron feels a big theme emerging of settling down. Into his faith, his marriage, and what matters.

""I like thinking about things over time. How they'll get to the point they'll get to. Like compound interest.""

"Whispering Jack: The John Farnham Musical to premiere in Sydney Theatre Company's 2026 season Whispering Jack: The John Farnham Musical will premiere in Sydney in November next year, as the blockbuster album celebrates its 40th anniversary.

Set between 1980 and 1986, Whispering Jack tells the story of Farnham's comeback, from struggling former pop star to the voice of the all-time highest-selling album by an Australian artist.

Farnham met Jill when they both performed in Charlie Girl in 1971. In a statement he said: “Musicals have always held a very special place in my heart."" (Pictured: Farnham on Countdown in the 80s.) (Supplied: ABC Archives)

It is also the story of the people who believed in Farnham: from his wife Jill; to his manager Glenn Wheatley and his wife, Gaynor, who mortgaged their house to fund the album.

The musical's writer Jack Yabsley (ABC TV's Gold Diggers) describes the period as ""zero to hero"" — and that's what makes it so compelling.

""What does that mean when you've had success as a [teenager] to be 35 and down and out?"" Yabsley says.

""And to have the strength to take all those risks to change your sound, your name, everything that you're doing and say, 'I still have something to say'.

""As someone who works in the arts, that's something I can relate to so deeply.

"" I know how it feels to constantly be thinking, I hope this project works because I don't have a backup plan here. ""

Sydney Theatre Company (STC) artistic director Mitchell Butel will direct Whispering Jack, one of 13 shows in his first season at the helm of the company.

It also includes a new play about the AFLW from Prima Facie writer Suzie Miller, an adaptation of Homer's The Iliad starring David Wenham, and Miranda Otto's return to the stage after 15 years, in The River by Jez Butterworth.

""I've been trying to lure David back to the theatre for many years,"" STC artistic director Mitchell Butel says. (Pictured: David Wenham and Miranda Otto.) (Supplied: STC/Holly Ward)

Bringing Farnham's story to the STC is special for Butel, who was four years old when he saw the singer star as Pippin in Sydney in 1974.

""For many people, their first entrée into theatre is through musical theatre,"" Butel says.

""Whispering Jack: The John Farnham Musical is not traditional Sydney Theatre Company fare … [but] it's something I think will hook a different, younger, more rock 'n' roll crowd.""

A hardcore fan at the helm

Yabsley describes himself as a ""hardcore fan"" of Farnham, who grew up listening to the singer — especially Whispering Jack — on long drives through regional NSW.

Later, the family also listened to the Jesus Christ Superstar cast recording from 1992, which featured Farnham as Jesus.

""After a trip to and from Coonabarabran to Sydney, my mum snapped the CD because we had listened to it non-stop for 16 hours,"" Yabsley says.

About a decade on, the writer even snuck into a John Farnham concert in Sydney by posing as a waiter.

""I was metres away from my hero, watching him just wail on stage,"" he recalls. ""I had one of the greatest nights of my life.""

When Yabsley heard Michael Cassel Group, the company behind the international tour of The Picture of Dorian Gray, was developing a Farnham musical, he knew he needed to write it.

Yabsley's first dance at his wedding was to Farnham and Olivia Newton-John's Two Strong Hearts. (Supplied: STC/Nic Walker)

Cassel and co-producer Gaynor Wheatley were intrigued by his pitch.

""I think they liked the direction I was going in because I kept coming back to [the idea that] this show has to be funny and it has to make you feel good, because that's what John does on stage,"" Yabsley says.

""An audience needs to be having laughs and all the feels and then their hearts broken and then feeling joyous.""

Space for difference

They are the same feelings audiences can expect to have watching the mix of plays in STC's 2026 season.

STC's 2026 season Purpose by Brandon Jacobs-Jenkins

The Normal Heart by Larry Kramer

My Brilliant Career by Miles Franklin; adapted by Dean Bryant (book and music), Mat Frank (music) and Sheridan Harbridge (book)

The River by Jez Butterworth

An Iliad by Homer; adapted by Lisa Peterson and Denis O'Hare

Doubt: A Parable by John Patrick Shanley

Bennelong in London by Jane Harrison

Housework by Emily Steel

Girls & Boys by Dennis Kelly

The Unfriend by Steven Moffat

Strong Is the New Pretty by Suzie Miller

The Gospel According to Paul: The Second Coming by Jonathan Biggins

Whispering Jack: The John Farnham Musical by Jack Yabsley

Butel says his first season at STC is about ""holding space for difference"" — whether in comedies like Doctor Who writer Steven Moffat's The Unfriend, dramas like Brandon Jacobs-Jenkins's Tony-winning Purpose, or musicals like Whispering Jack.

""In every show, a point of view is changed because of a conflict or rhetoric or persuasion or an event,"" Butel says.

""Theatre does that better than any other medium.""

The season stemmed from conversations Butel had with artists about the stories they wanted to tell in 2026.

Those artists included actors who haven't worked with the company in years, like Wenham, who last performed with STC in 1997.

""I [asked], 'What would be the thing that would entice you back here?'"" Butel says.

""Brilliant world premieres are important, but also actors that audiences love help sell the season.""

And STC needs to sell the season as the box office is its main source of revenue. At the same time, government funding and philanthropy are in decline, with the company posting a loss of $565,759 in 2024.

""We're looking under every rock, [asking] 'How can we ensure that the money that we're spending goes onto the stage?'"" Butel says.

The company has turned towards advocacy, lobbying the government for more sustainable arts funding and a tax offset for pre-production expenses.

Such a rebate would be akin to the producer offset offered to the Australian film industry.

""It would be transformative,"" Butel says.

The best writing from Australia and the world

Alongside three world premieres of new Australian work — Whispering Jack, Suzie Miller's Strong Is the New Pretty, and Bennelong in London by Muruwari playwright Jane Harrison (Stolen) — the 2026 season includes seven plays from overseas.

One of those is American playwright Larry Kramer's drama about the AIDS crisis, The Normal Heart, which opened at STC almost 40 years ago, in 1989.

""I was 19, and that show changed my life,"" Butel says.

"" STC brings brilliant world theatre to Sydney, and it also takes brilliant Sydney theatre [like Dorian Gray] to the world. ""

The production of The Normal Heart coming to STC next year first opened at State Theatre Company South Australia (STCSA) in 2022, with Butel starring as Kramer's alter-ego Ned. He'll be reprising the role in the STC season.

""I wanted to display to audiences, 'There's a shift [from former artistic director Kip Williams],'"" he explains.

""You've got someone returning to the company who you know primarily as an actor — I've done 17 shows here — and I wanted to re-begin the journey with the audience in that way.""",Whispering Jack: The John Farnham Musical to premiere in Sydney Theatre Company's 2026 season,Music,N/A,Abc,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-15/whispering-jack-john-farnham-musical-sydney-theatre-company-2026/105766868,2025-09-15 00:00:00,"""Whispering Jack: The John Farnham Musical"" will debut in Sydney in November 2026, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of Farnham's iconic album.

"Bush band tells Aboriginal people's side of the Maralinga nuclear weapon tests story For Liam Tunkin, making music is about continuing his late father's legacy and sharing a dark part of Australia's history.

Mr Tunkin said his father, who died about a decade ago, sang about the land and country, including nuclear weapons tests at Maralinga in South Australia.

""They don't have no idea what happened back in the days, that's the reason my father make song about the history, about the Maralinga,"" he said.

"" That's the message for all Aboriginal people, so they can listen and think about the memory, about all the Aboriginal people and what happened in the past with Maralinga bomb. ""

In the 1950 and 60s, atomic bombs were detonated in remote parts of Australia.

According to the National Museum of Australia, Britain, with approval from the Australian government, tested the nuclear weapons at three sites, the Montebello Islands off Western Australia, and Emu Field and Maralinga in South Australia.

The trials at Maralinga caused dangerous radioactive contamination for hundreds of thousands of square kilometres around the bomb site, harming those who lived on the land, including many Indigenous families.

Mr Tunkin said he was looking forward to singing his father's song, so people could connect with the history.

""I'm so happy to step into the light … I'm glad to play one of my Dad's songs,"" he said.

21 years of Bush Bands Bash

Ilkari Maru is one of 10 Indigenous artists and bands that are playing at the Bush Bands Bash in Alice Springs on Sunday afternoon.

The concert, expected to attract an audience of about 3,000 people, as been held annually for 21 years.

It is the highlight event of a development program to help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander musicians break into the music industry.

Coordinator Zoe Curren said the program was designed to help bands navigate the complex industry.

""We're dealing with some of the most remote artists in the world and it's bringing them here and helping them understand what the music industry is about and providing them with tools to navigate that,"" she said.

""Apart from the geographic isolation that they have to face … some of the bands come from lower socio-economic backgrounds.

""There are also people who don't have access to internet, that's really hard.""

Indigenous musicians receive coaching from industry figures as part of the development program. (ABC Alice Springs: Victoria Ellis)

The development program connects remote musicians with industry professionals to receive coaching in vocals, performance, stagecraft and equipment.

Ms Curren said the program also offered workshops and information on how to get a gig, using social media, artist management and understanding contracts and legal documents.

""Being able to help people come in and create pathways and then help them out into the world I think is a really important thing,"" she said.

Diversity increasing

Broome artist Tornina ""Matalja"" Torres makes up the one-woman band Matalja.

Matalja said her songs reflected on real life experiences and emotions.

""It usually comes from stuff that I'm going through … I write to get to know myself better, I write to find solutions,"" she said.

""I also want and hope that my music, the message and the vibe, emotional energy in my music that I'm writing for my own healing, may also benefit someone else in their healing journey.""

Matalja is the first female artist to join the mainstream Bush Bands development program, rather than the Divas program, which is specifically for women.

""I feel humbled by it,"" she said.

""And good on any woman that's going to apply, you know, sista girls, you go, you do it, don't anything hold you back, you believe in you.""

"Adrianne Lenker on Big Thief's evolution and the making of Double Infinity Greek philosopher Heraclitus told us 2,500 years ago that change was a constant. Yet humans still tend to find flux deeply uncomfortable.

Revered Brooklyn indie rock band Big Thief understand change — its challenges and its benefits — intimately.

Their ever-evolving take on folk-inflected indie rock demands comfort with shifting sounds and moods. Each member's restless creative nature means they are always eager to make art beyond the band they share.

Big Thief wanted an ""ecstatic feeling"" to run through their sixth album, Double Infinity. (Supplied: 4AD/Remote Control)

While change is constant in their lives and their creative work, Big Thief remains a kind of grounding force that drives everything they do.

""Every time we go off and do our own solo things and do other projects, it feeds back into our band,"" frontwoman Adrianne Lenker tells Double J's Karen Leng.

""We take all the things that we learn, and we inevitably just grow and get better as musicians from each project. I think that always ends up coming back and filling up the Big Thief cup.""

Even by their standards, the past couple of years have been especially disruptive. Founding bassist Max Oleartchik left the band last year for interpersonal reasons.

Loading Instagram content

""Our love for each other is infinite, and we are so grateful for all we have shared these many years together since the beginning of our journey as a band,"" the group wrote on social media.

""We wouldn't be who we are without Max. This separation marks the end of an era, and the beginning of a new one for Big Thief.""

That new era meant the core trio — Lenker, drummer James Krivchenia, guitarist Buck Meek — had to reimagine what their next statement would sound like without Oleartchik's significant musical contributions.

""It was a big emotional split for the band, and we needed a lot of time to regroup as the three of us and sort of ground down,"" Krivchenia tells Double J.

""We did a lot of writing and a lot of talking, and just kept growing this pile [of songs], trying to find what the centre of gravity for the next record was going to be.

""Slowly there started to be this conglomeration of songs, where it's like, 'This feels kind of like the core.'""

Key elements: collaboration, drones, laughter

That core became Double Infinity, a lean collection of nine songs that contrasts the sprawling ambition of 2022's Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You.

Though the band has formally shrunk to three members, the album thrives on collaboration.

A large cast of musicians joined the trio at New York's legendary Power Station studios, working over three weeks to bring their songs to life.

The ensemble gathered each afternoon and played late into the night, chasing a kind of transcendent jubilance they felt was embedded in the material.

""I feel like all these songs really lend themselves to the arrangements that we were envisioning, in terms of having this bigger band,"" Lenker says.

""We wanted this ecstatic feeling and this high frequency, like some momentum on the album.""

Loading Instagram content

They also wanted a drone element to subtly thread through the record — a sonic undercurrent that supported the arrangements without drawing attention.

""I think the through line and what connects a lot of these songs is either an element of trance or drone,"" Lenker says.

""Maybe it's happening underneath it all, and you don't even notice it, but that is happening on the whole album. If a song didn't lend itself to that, it didn't make the cut.

"" So many of the songs that we had to cut, we loved just as much, but they just didn't fit this vibe, with all these musicians and what we were going for. ""

Some of that drone comes courtesy of ambient and new age pioneer Laraaji, who entered the band's orbit in a fittingly mystical way.

""Adrianne got his business card when they were jamming together during a lunar eclipse on a mountain at a music festival,"" Krivchenia says.

""We had all been fans of his work for a while. We've been to some of his laughter workshops at festivals and been fans of his records and seen him play a lot.""

Big Thief invited a lot of friends to play with them on Double Infinity. (Supplied: Genesis Báez)

When the idea of building a larger band emerged, Laraaji's name came up — and it made sense.

""When we were thinking about it, building this big band, we were like, 'We need a droner.' Once Laraaji's name got thrown into this circle, we're just like, 'Of course.'""

His musicality matched the band's vision, and his presence brought something deeper.

""I've only really heard him play alone, so I was curious what he would be like with other people,"" Krivchenia says.

""But also, knowing him a little bit through being in his laughter workshops and seeing him play live, he seems like a really interesting presence that we could probably learn a lot from in the studio for three weeks. Sign me up for that.""

Loading Instagram content

Laughter meditation is one of Laraaji's trademarks. While he did not lead any sessions during recording, Big Thief had already felt their power.

""I did take one of his laughter workshops in Kerrville, at the Kerrville Folk Festival, and it was awesome,"" Lenker says.

""He teaches you to laugh from all the different parts of your body,"" Krivchenia says. ""You're learning these techniques, sort of a schematic experience of laughter. Also, people are just bursting out into real laughter because it's also contagious. It's a very beautiful thing, you're learning about your body, but you're also just cracking up.""

Loading...

Big Thief's music runs the emotional gamut — any fan who has not shed a tear or stifled a chuckle is probably not paying attention. That ""ecstatic feeling"" they were chasing notably found its way into the third single, Los Angeles, which opens with a patchwork of laughter, preserving the joy of the session.

""That was a real moment of us bursting out laughing,"" Lenker recalls.

""It was kind of like a domino effect where everyone just started laughing and then we were like kicking into the song. We all lost our headphones during that take, and it didn't even matter.""

How Big Thief help us remember that life is full of both pain and beauty Photo shows Four members of Big Thief stand close together. One member has his arm around Adrianne Lenker's sternum. ""I always feel like I write about the simplest yet most perplexing things.""

It was emblematic of the spirit that ran through the Double Infinity sessions: fun, open-hearted and deeply present.

""There was just this spirit,"" Lenker says. ""I feel like everyone left their stuff at the door and everyone just was there to be very present and put their best foot forward. To open their hearts to the music.

""It made for quite a joyous experience. I just felt like everyone was right there, like we were having a musical conversation, and no one was really analysing it.""

Change — like the sky, like the leaves, like a butterfly

Big Thief made some big changes on the road to Double Infinity, but change has always been part of their story.

""It's kind of hard to have any perspective,"" Krivchenia says. ""It all feels like this churning, changing thing.

""I feel like everything we've ever done, every tour, every year that goes by, you're always like, 'Whoa, we're different', or, 'We're levelling up', or there's some emotional breakthrough in a talk we had.

""There's all these little points along the way where, like, 'that was actually really big', but was kind of hard to feel in the moment.

""I hope every record sort of feels like a new chapter in some way. I don't want to be retreading unless that's the goal.""

"British YouTube creator Yung Filly to travel home to UK on bail for sexual assault charges British YouTube content creator Yung Filly, who's facing trial in Perth on sex assault charges, has been granted permission to travel home to the UK for the first time since he was arrested.

The entertainer, whose real name is Andres Felipe Valencia Barrientos, allegedly raped a woman in his Perth hotel room after a performance at a nightclub in the city's north in September last year.

He was arrested in Brisbane before being extradited to Perth in October, where he has stayed since as part of his strict bail conditions.

But District Court Judge Gary William Massey has allowed an amendment to the bail conditions, clearing Mr Barrientos to travel home to the UK on Tuesday for almost four months.

"Artists and users boycotting Spotify over AI use and CEO's military tech A few weeks ago, Melbourne musician Fenn Wilson announced to fans that he was boycotting Spotify.

""All I said was … this may not make a major difference to them, but they never really made much of a difference to us either.""

His band, Fenn Wilson & The Weather, joins a growing list of Australian artists who have pulled their full catalogues off the streaming platform, including psych-rock band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, folk artist Leah Senior and contemporary musician David Bridie.

Similarly, American indie rock bands including Deerhoof, Xiu Xiu, and Hotline TNT, have announced their exit.

""As individual, small artists, it's hard to … strike a massive blow to a company like Spotify,"" Fenn says.

""But I think that if a bunch of us are able to get themselves off … then they start to sweat a little.""

Why are people boycotting Spotify?

In June, it was revealed that Spotify's chief executive, Daniel Ek, led a billion-dollar investment into Helsing, a German military technology company that specialises in developing artificial intelligence systems.

It is something Fenn Wilson, and some other musicians, say they wanted to protest.

""I've always seen music as a sort of reflection of myself,"" he says. ""If it's available on something that doesn't reflect who I am, then I don't think that it has a place there.

""To corrupt something that somebody has made with beautiful intent that harshly is unforgivable.""

Fenn Wilson (second left), with his band The Weather, says he has made ""maybe $200"" from Spotify since 2019. (Supplied: Laura May Grogan)

It is not just artists — some listeners say they are boycotting too.

Hiro was a Spotify Premium user but tells triple j hack he stopped paying for a subscription after learning of the CEO's investments.

He said his involvement in the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement against Israeli products, which responds to its actions in Gaza and the West Bank, meant he's already mindful of where he spends his money.

""If I don't want to buy a canned beverage because its parent company invests a lot in Israel, why am I paying like $11, $15 so that the CEO can invest that money I paid to a weapons company?""

A tipping point

Dr Sophie Freeman is a researcher of music streaming and algorithmic recommendation at the University of Melbourne. ""We're at a bit of a tipping point right now,"" she says.

""People are definitely making the switch due to the news that Daniel Ek is investing in AI battle tech. But … this has been going on for a long time.""

Back in 2014, Taylor Swift removed her entire music catalogue from Spotify to protest what she said was the platform's low royalty payouts to artists.

""And they still are [low],"" Dr Freeman says, ""which is another big reason people might be boycotting"".

A single song stream on Spotify might generate as little as $0.004 in royalties. Additionally, songs cannot earn revenue until they reach more than 1,000 streams.

A spokesperson says Spotify Australia ""can't comment on the personal investments"" of Daniel Ek. (Reuters: Shannon Stapleton/File)

""In 2024, royalties generated by Australian artists from Spotify reached over $300 million, up 14 per cent since 2023,"" a spokesperson for Spotify Australia told triple j hack.

Additionally, Spotify says ""more than half"" of those royalties were generated by independent artists or labels.

But Fenn Wilson says this does not reflect his experience.

He released his first album in 2019, and estimates he has made ""maybe $200"" from Spotify earnings throughout his entire time on the platform.

""Australian artists are not well represented on streaming services,"" Dr Freeman says. ""Both artists and listeners are really missing out.""

The rise of AI-generated music

Another part of the growing backlash is Spotify's use of AI tools and AI-generated music. And some listeners say they are concerned about whether ""fake"" music has already crept into their playlists.

""Hearing that it's a possibility that you could be duped into listening to something that was created by an algorithm instead of someone's hard work … and love into the music, I didn't like that,"" Hiro says.

In June, a band called The Velvet Sundown released their debut album on Spotify, appearing across multiple user-specific ""Discover Weekly"" playlists.

It was not until it was confirmed by journalists that it was revealed The Velvet Sundown were not real.

The music and press shots of the ""band"" were AI-generated, and Spotify — like most streamers — did not label them as such.

Here's how streamers serving AI-generated music hurts real artists Photo shows An AI-generated image of four male musicians on stage under yellow lights. They are quite close together. Tens of thousands of AI-generated songs are uploaded to streamers each day. But they're just the tip of the iceberg of fake artists.

The Velvet Sundown still attracts more than 330,000 monthly listeners, which critics of Spotify say raises concerns about how this competes with real artists.

Spotify Australia has policies around AI use and takes steps to ensure AI doesn't deceive subscribers or impersonate artists.

Spotify also has policies around taking down content that is deceptive.

Dr Freeman says major streamers are already saturated with content.

""The sheer volume of music that is going up on streaming platforms,"" she says. ""It's about 100,000 songs every single day.

""The promise of getting discovered on Spotify is kind of not being fulfilled now.""

When it comes to how much rights holders and artists are paid by competing services, such as Apple Music, TIDAL and YouTube Music, ""there's not that much difference between all of them"", says Dr Freeman.

""I think if you want to be supporting artists, which I know a lot of people do, the best thing you can do is buy music directly.""

The Spotify narrative

Spotify was founded in Sweden in 2006 but officially launched in Australia in 2012. Along with other digital streaming platforms, it heralded the end of the music piracy era and the start of subscription-based access.

Fenn Wilson says there is an expectation for musicians to be on there.

""It felt like, if you weren't on Spotify, then you may as well not release it,"" he says.

Amy is a podcast producer and has been streaming music on Spotify for a decade.

""This narrative that Spotify has been able to push about themselves — that in their early days they were really shaking up the music industry,"" she says. ""Bring the power away from these record companies.

"" The narrative that they sold about it being better for independent artists wasn't true at all. ""

Amy cancelled and deleted her Spotify account, not long after reading a book by American music journalist Liz Pelly titled 'Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist'.

In it, Pelly argues that music from major labels dominates featured playlists and content on Spotify.

""It's just a pretty blatant example of how the platform really isn't fair and isn't an equitable system of treating artists,"" Amy says.

Has streaming changed our listening habits?

Technology has long shaped the way we consume media, and the way streaming allows instantaneous access to a vast catalogue is no exception.

""My brain is just wired to prioritise the convenience and the immediacy of it,"" Hiro says. ""I'm slowly trying to get back into a more conscious listening experience.""

The rise of playlists — as Pelly's book argues — has prioritised passive music listening.

""We have all at one point used music as a motivational tool or something in the background to try and keep us focused,"" Amy says.

Dr Freeman says this is by design. ""The main goal of Spotify … is to keep us on the platform, keep us engaged. And the best way to do that is to give us safe and familiar content.""

It means users might be finding it harder to discover new music, with recommendations potentially becoming a feedback-loop of songs already on rotation.

""If they serve up something that's a little bit too outside of your taste or too out there, then people might leave and go to another service,"" Dr Freeman says.

Spotify is also impacting how we perceive the value of music.

""It used to be like $25 for a CD,"" Fenn Wilson says. ""The fact that Spotify is paying as [little] as they are now has diluted the value of music.

"" There are now going to be generations of people that have grown up thinking that that's how much music is worth. And to a certain degree, that's irreversible. ""

The bells and whistles of Spotify

Spotify recently increased its Premium subscription prices and introduced 'Lossless' audio, allowing streaming at higher quality.

It joins recent features like AI DJ and AI Playlist, new ""Mix"" functions for ""seamless transitions"" between songs, and Spotify's ""daylist"" — a playlist that changes throughout the day to capture a user's mood.

But Hiro is not convinced the value of the service has improved.

""They had an AI DJ,"" he says. ""That didn't stick with me … it kind of felt weird.""

The weirdness of Spotify Wrapped Photo shows composite image featuring chappell roan, overmono and something for kate On Spotify Wrapped day, we share the music we loved. But sometimes the data just doesn't seem to match up with our expectations.

The newer features also did not resonate with Amy, including the annual ""Spotify Wrapped"", which has copped heat from users over potentially inaccurate and gimmicky data.

""The discourse around Spotify Wrapped being not as good as previous years,"" Amy says. ""You know, 'You're giving Princess Pony Pilates' … seemed to be a swing and a miss.

""The push of trying to have podcasts, video on the platform … the 'daylists'; I think it definitely has lost some cultural cachet,"" Amy says.

What next?

Would Hiro, Amy or Fenn Wilson ever go back to Spotify? That is a resounding no.

They all collect and listen to vinyl records when they can. As for streaming, Hiro mainly uses Bandcamp and sometimes YouTube, while Amy and Fenn have switched to major streamer TIDAL.

Music by Fenn Wilson & The Weather is available on Bandcamp and all other major streamers.

In terms of supporting artists, Wilson says buying their music or merchandise and going to gigs is the best way to show up.

""I'm really interested in curation … and curators,"" Dr Freeman says. ""That is something that people are really connected to because Spotify is a lot of programmed or algorithmically recommended music that's put into playlists.

""I think that people are really drawn to a human person putting together music and hearing this stories, because music is really personal.

""Buying music directly from the artist or buying it in a record store … you're having a direct connection,"" she says. ""It's kind of more meaningful than getting a playlist made by a recommender system.""

But despite the boycott, Fenn Wilson thinks changing streaming services will not actually fix some of music's deeper problems.

""I would love to see … the government set a minimum rate so that if there are these streaming platforms that come along and want Australian artists,"" he says. ""Then this is how much you've got to pay them.

""That would be a dream.""",Artists and users boycotting Spotify over AI use and CEO's military tech,Music,N/A,Abc,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-12/spotify-boycott-daniel-ek-ai-music-military-tech-fenn-wilson/105765846,2025-09-12 00:00:00,"A growing number of artists, including Fenn Wilson and King Gizzard, are boycotting Spotify due to concerns over low royalties and the CEO's investment in military technology.

"Sydney live music venue embraces grant for soundproofing amid noise complaint concerns When the Red Rattler theatre in Marrickville installed acoustic foam in the walls behind its stage, it did not just make the venue soundproof — but future-proof.

In Sydney's inner west, where noise complaints can sometimes become the final nail in the coffin for a struggling venue, it pays to be prepared.

""Even though they've put new laws in … I know that there's always that one person or that one thing, there's always a loophole,"" the venue's senior program manager, Kween G said.

New laws toughened the process around noise complaints in NSW as of last year.

Among the changes, disputes against a premises will favour the party who occupied the area first, to stop residents restricting the offerings of already-established venues.

Kween G says soundproofing has been a game changer for this inner west live music venue. (ABC News: Berge Breiland)

Once construction began on apartments in the streets behind the Red Rattler, it became even more crucial to ensure the building, which once sat in a primarily industrial area, could continue hosting live shows.

The theatre is among several venues given state government funding to install soundproofing as part of a grant program launched in 2024.

Kween G said once the work was completed, the noise complaints largely dried up, and the quality of performances inside the converted warehouse space improved dramatically.

""I often stand at the back of the room and go, 'Wow, it sounds really good in here',"" she said.

"" It sounds crisp, it's clear, it's made a massive difference. ""

The state government's grant program has been expanded this year — giving venues across NSW a share of $5.1 million for soundproofing, equipment upgrades and professional advice.

The Red Rattler in Marrickville is taking advantage of the grants from the NSW government. (ABC News: Berge Breiland)

Minister for Music and the Night-time Economy John Graham said the program was aimed at keeping the NSW music scene alive.

""Over a decade of [lockout laws] followed by the COVID lockdowns, we lost a lot of music venues … we're determined to keep the ones we've got,"" he said.

Mr Graham said the initiative has been well-received by locals who live nearby.

"" It means a quiet night's sleep near the venue, and a good night out inside the venue. ""

John Graham, pictured next to Kween G, says the aim of the grants is to keep the music scene alive. (ABC News: Berge Breiland)

The Red Rattler also used its funding to install new air-conditioning, sound equipment and DJ software.

Kween G said the work cost close to $250,000 in total — and they would not have been able to afford it themselves.

""We would have to ask for donations, we would be calling out for people to help us to raise the money.

""Like, you'd go, 'Are you going to pay the mortgage or are you going to fix the air quality?'""

Venues across NSW embrace future-proof funding

In total, 39 venues across the state are receiving funding under the program — including nearby Enmore Theatre also in the inner west, Elton Chong in Penrith and The Servo in Port Kembla.

Underground bar Club 77 in Sydney's Darlinghurst is spending its grant money on accessible upgrades including a lift, disabled toilets and a wheelchair-friendly DJ box.

Tim Blunt, who fronts Sydney-based band FVNERAL, said having the right facilities can make or break an act.

Tim Blunt says audiences are hyperaware of quality sound technology in live music venues. (ABC News: Berge Breiland)

""There's nothing more distracting when you're trying to play a show than the sound being bad and clearly recognising that the audience is aware that the sound is not as good as it should be,"" they said.

""You can't get to be selling out a 500-capacity room if you haven't been able to do that for 200, 100 and 50.

""Without those venues, there are no bands that are any bigger.""

Kween G agreed it is crucial for places like the Red Rattler to be given ongoing support from governments and councils.

"Jaime Martín on bringing the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra on tour to the UK and Europe What would make you fall so much in love with an Australian city that you would move halfway across the world, from the heartland of classical music, to lead its orchestra?

That's the question Jaime Martín, the chief conductor of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (MSO), answered ahead of his first European tour with the group.

""Melbourne is a city [that asks] you to leave your bed, come into the streets, have breakfast, have coffee, walk around and feel the energy of the city,"" Martín shares.

""And it has a wonderful orchestra, so what is not to like?""

Jaime Martín charted a path from a professional flute player to one of Europe's leading orchestral conductors. (BBC Proms: Chris Christodoulou)

A native of Santander, a historic port city in Spain, Martín fell in love with classical music as a child. He charted a path from being a professional flute player to becoming one of Europe's leading orchestral conductors.

He officially took up the reins as chief conductor of the MSO in 2022.

Since establishing himself in Melbourne, Martín has championed prominent Australian composers, including figures such as pioneer Margaret Sutherland and First Nations trailblazer Deborah Cheetham Fraillon.

We spoke with Martín just before the start of the tour, where he shared the significance of the MSO's long-awaited visit to his hometown.

Taking an Australian symphony orchestra home

Martín grew up in Santander, on the northern coast of the Iberian Peninsula.

Unlike Melbourne and other Australian capital cities, the town didn't have a resident symphony orchestra when Martín was growing up. But since 1952, Santander has hosted a month-long international festival of music and dance every summer.

""I was not interested in music until my father took me to a concert at the Santander International Festival when I was eight,"" Martín shares.

"" I loved it so much, the next day I [told] my parents I would like to learn to play an instrument. ""

Martín heard Mussorgsky's Pictures At An Exhibition during that fateful first concert.

Decades later, after making a career in the music world, including a stint as director of the Santander International Festival between 2012-2020, Martín performed the same piece of music with the MSO at the festival where it all began.

""[This time] instead of being an eight-year-old boy looking at the stage with my father, I was conducting,"" Martín says.

It was a remarkable moment for the audiences at Santander, with an orchestra from the other side of the world making a debut performance with one of their own ""son of this land."" They gave a standing ovation.

Guide to Listening: BBC Proms on ABC Classic Photo shows Close up of Anja Bihlmaier conducting the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall. Your guide to listening to the BBC Proms on ABC Classic through September.

Another milestone for the orchestra during the tour was their appearance at the BBC Proms in London's Royal Albert Hall.

It's rare for an Australian orchestra to perform at the world's biggest classical music festival and only the second time the MSO has performed there. They made their Proms debut in 2014.

Martín curated a program including Haunted Hills by Australian Composer Margaret Sutherland, Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto with soloist Khatia Buniatishvili, and Dvořák's Sixth Symphony.

The performance of the Sutherland was interrupted by pro-Palestine protesters, and the orchestra restarted the music from the top.

""The London performance was the culmination of the MSO's successful tour of Europe,"" says a spokesperson for the orchestra. ""We are so proud of the MSO's artistry and professionalism. They delivered world-class performances and artistic excellence to sold-out audiences across the UK and Europe.""

Huge trucks and chartered flights

There were more than 100 people on this international tour, Martín says.

The orchestra started in Edinburgh, which might just be one of the longest trips from Australia.

Although most musicians are seasoned travellers, the journey is still quite an undertaking especially for big instrument players like cellos, double bases and timpani.

Once they were in Europe, the orchestra hired huge trucks and chartered flights to get all of those musicians and instruments between cities.

Working out the logistics of a tour like this takes a lot of organisations from a lot of people, Martín says.

A year before the tour, the orchestra sent a team over to scout details like how to get from the hotels to the performance venues, where the stage doors are, even where to get coffee during breaks.

""It's a big operation, but it's how it is in the world of orchestra touring,"" Martín says.

The orchestra travelled across Europe: from Edinburgh to Santander, Südtirol in Italy, Hamburg in Germany and then back to London. They performed to mostly sold-out audiences.

Sharing Australian voices with international audiences

Martín chose music by Margaret Sutherland and Deborah Cheetham Fraillon to open concerts during the tour. These are composers Martín only discovered when he came to Australia.

He now champions them.

His first concert with the MSO in 2022 was a world premiere of new music by Cheetham Fraillon featuring didgeridoo/yidaki virtuoso William Barton.

""My first big international tour with the orchestra is a very good opportunity to write another piece as a continuation of what we started,"" Martín says.

Martín commissioned Cheetham Fraillon to compose Treaty, music which encapsulates the dialogue between the First Nations peoples and the Victorian state government in the process towards reconciliation.

Treaty saw the return of Barton as soloist. The music was premiered at the Edinburgh festival and performed in Hamburg.

Martín also discovered Sutherland's music after moving to Melbourne.

Jaime Martín conducts the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in music by Dvořák, Tchaikovsky and Margaret Sutherland in this performance at the BBC Proms in London's Royal Albert Hall.

""She was an important musician in Melbourne and because of her, the Art Centre was created,"" Martín says, referring to Sutherland's advocacy for a dedicated performance venue in Melbourne.

Now known as Hamer Hall, it is the venue the orchestra calls home.

Sutherland was a prolific composer who had been neglected because she was a woman living in an era when it wasn't acceptable for women to write music, Martín says.

""It's important to celebrate the pioneers,"" he says.

Haunted Hills was composed in 1950, with Sutherland describing the music as: ""A sound picture written in contemplation of the first people who roamed the hills, their bewilderment and their betrayal.""

These are members of the Kulin Nations who lived in the Dandenong Ranges just outside Narrm/Melbourne.

""[A lot of people] have never heard of the music of Margaret Sutherland,"" Martín says. ""I think that's very exciting and that's why we are taking this music on our tour.""

Martín attributed the enthusiasm that saw most concerts being sold out to people's curiosity to hear an orchestra from Australia.

""People are really excited to be challenged and to hear something different,"" Martín says.

"" If you present [the music] with love, people will notice. ""

"The Spice Girls dominated pop charts in the 90s, but Mel C says sexism almost held them back Maidenhead is a UK market town of about 70,000 people, which lies on the south-western bank of the River Thames. Famed for its historic brick railway bridge — it was also the site of the Spice Girls' first share house.

""I think it's maybe about an hour and a half out of London; a very suburban part of the UK,"" says Melanie Chisolm — otherwise known as Mel C, otherwise known as Sporty Spice.

After a management company held auditions for a new all-female band, and a few line-up tweaks, they moved five young women into their new house.

""I was given the nickname Sporty Spice, because alongside music, I love sport and being very athletic, whether that was dancing or gymnastics or netball or football."" (Supplied: Melanie Chisholm)

A 20-year-old Mel C shared a bedroom with Melanie Brown (Mel B, Scary Spice). Another room was shared by Victoria Adams (Posh Spice) and Emma Bunton (Baby Spice). Geri Halliwell (Ginger Spice) got her own room ""because she's the eldest"".

""And we would get in Geri's car every morning and poodle down to this church hall where we'd practise choreography and learn songs,"" Mel C, now 51, explains to Zan Rowe on Take 5.

The group of five lived together in this Wannabe pop star house for about a year.

""At the time, we were being given songs to sing that were being written by middle-aged men. So of course, that didn't go down very well, but we were getting to know each other, getting to figure out what we didn't like as well as what we did want to do.""

But cautious management was frustrating them.

""[They] just kept saying to us, 'You're not ready, you're not ready, don't try and run before you can walk. I think you need to lower your expectations',"" Mel explains.

""And we wanted to use it.""

While she acknowledges their Girl Power message was ""a lot more throwaway and fun"", Mel says it offered an accessible way for young girls to learn about feminism and their own power.

"Supertramp co-founder Rick Davies dies aged 81 Rick Davies, the co-founder and lead singer for British rock band Supertramp, has died aged 81 after a decade-long battle with cancer.

The group confirmed Davies' death on Sunday, local time.

As co-writer with partner Roger Hodgson, Davies was the voice and pianist behind Supertramp's most iconic songs, leaving a mark on rock music history with hits like Goodbye Stranger and Bloody Well Right.

""His soulful vocals and unmistakable touch on the Wurlitzer became the heartbeat of the band's sound,"" the band said, whose progressive rock was among the most successful in the 1970s and early 1980s.

Born in Swindon, England in 1944, Davies discovered his passion for music as a child listening to Gene Krupa's Drummin' Man, which sparked a lifelong love of jazz, blues and rock 'n' roll.

In 2015, the singer announced he was suffering from multiple myeloma, a bone marrow cancer, and began ""aggressive treatment"" that forced Supertramp to cancel a European tour.

He then suffered from it for over a decade, and the band never performed again.

The singer died on Saturday at his home on Long Island in the United States, according to Rolling Stone.

Supertramp achieved massive commercial success with albums including Crime of the Century (1974), Crisis? What Crisis? (1975), and their breakthrough Breakfast in America (1979), topping charts in the United States and Canada, winning two Grammys and selling more than 18 million copies worldwide.

Supertramp were known for their art rock albums and theatrical live performances, helping define the progressive rock era alongside pioneering bands like Pink Floyd and Yes.

""Beyond the stage, Davies was known for his warmth, resilience and devotion to his wife Sue, with whom he shared over five decades of marriage,"" the band said.

After serious health challenges forced him to stop touring with Supertramp, Davies continued performing with his local group Ricky and the Rockets in his hometown, they added.

But the artist couldn't stay, as she had to race across New York City to perform for her tour.

""I wish I could stay and watch all these amazing performances, but I have to go back to Madison Square Garden,"" she said.

Lady Gaga led award nominations with 12 nods for her album Mayhem.

She won four.

""Thank you 'little monsters', my fans, for always supporting me and for always supporting the monster in me,"" she said.

""And to my partner in all things, Michael, creating this year with you was a beautiful, beautiful dream, and you have been my partner every step of the way. I dedicate this to you, too, my love.""

Later in the show, a live stream showed her performance of the songs Abracadabra and Dead Dance at her concert.

She will take her tour, the Mayhem Ball, to Australia in December.

Gaga's win prevented the nominated Beyonce or Taylor Swift from emerging as the most honoured artist in VMA history. The pair remain tied at 30 VMAs each.

Mariah Carey takes home first VMA and the Video Vanguard award

Ariana Grande, who is often compared vocally with Mariah Carey, introduced the pop diva's Video Vanguard performance, where she sang a medley of her greatest hits, including We Belong Together, Fantasy and Obsessed.

""As a songwriter and producer, she's given us an anthem for every occasion,"" Ariana Grande said before introducing Carey.

""As a vocalist, there's only one queen, and that's Mariah.

""She knows no limits with her iconic 5-octave range and has left an irrevocable impact with her tone, technique and sound.""

Despite winning the Video Vanguard Award, Mariah Carey won her first VMA (Best R&B song) during the 2025 awards.

""I don't know why it took so long. Just kidding,"" she said.

""I just have one question, what in the Sam Hill are you waiting for?"" she later told the audience.

""Music videos are my way of life, of bringing music to my own life.

""And let's be honest, sometimes there's just an excuse to bring the drama and do things I wouldn't do in real life.""

Tributes for Ozzy Osbourne

Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, Joe Perry and singer Yungblud performed a stirring rendition of some of Ozzy Osbourne's greatest hits in tribute to the metal icon who died last month.

The Prince of Darkness's son, Jack, and his grandchildren introduced the tribute with his famous catchphrase, ""Let's go Crazy!""

The performance opened with British singer Yungblud singing Crazy Train.

Yungblud is known for his close relationship with Osbourne and seemed emotional as he sang Black Sabbath's song Changes.

The 27-year-old alt-rock and punk-rock artist's 2022 music video The Funeral featured Sharon and Ozzy.

Following Osbourne's death, he wrote online: ""I will never forget you — you will be in every single note I sing and with me every single time I walk on stage … You were the greatest of all time.""

Steven Tyler and Joe Perry joined him to sing Mama, I'm Coming Home.

""Ozzy forever,"" Yungblud said as he ended the performance.

Video of the Year goes to Ariana Grande

She opened her speech with a joke about her height as she tried to lower the microphone.

The singer, who just this year starred in Wicked, released an album and announced a tour, took her second speech of the night to thank her fans and collaborators.

""Art has been a safe space for me since I was a kid,"" she said.

""I'm so grateful that I get to do this with my life and to have such fiercely loving and supportive fans.""

She said the song was ""about the hard work that is healing all different kinds of trauma and coming home to our young selves and creating safety in our own lives, which is a lifelong process and a daily exercise.""

""If you're on that journey, please continue onward because I promise there are brighter days ahead.""

Busta Rhymes, Ricky Martin's careers celebrated

Two new achievement awards were introduced at this year's ceremony to celebrate Ricky Martin and Busta Rhymes.

Busta Rhymes accepts his award.

Busta Rhymes received the Rock the Bells Visionary Award, which celebrated his ""boundary-breaking cultural impact and indomitable musical career"".

He performed a medley of hits, and in his speech, he honoured MTV VJ Ananda Lewis, who died of cancer in June.

He also made a point about how it took decades to win his first VMA award.

""Next time y'all take 35 years to give me one of these, y'all gonna let me talk as long as I want.""

Martin was presented with the first-ever Latin Icon Award, 26 years after he took home a VMA for his hit Livin' la Vida Loca.

He thanked his children and his fans.

""Thank you so much for your applause. I am addicted to your applause,"" he said.

""That's why I keep coming back.""

Sabrina Carpenter makes a statement during her performance

During the performance of her new single Tears, Sabrina Carpenter took to the stage with an ensemble of drag queens.

They held up signs that read ""Protect Trans Rights"", ""Dolls Dolls Dolls"" and ""Support Drag"".

It was perhaps one of the only big political moments in an otherwise very uncontroversial VMAs.

President Donald Trump's decision to recognise only two sexes — male and female — has sparked growing concern and confusion among the LGBTQIA+ community in the United States.

Mr Trump signed an executive order recognising only male and female sexes and declaring they cannot be changed, shortly after being sworn in as president.

"BIGSOUND illustrates Australian music's depth amid challenging times The data makes one thing clear: we have a problem. Australian music no longer makes the charts, and hasn't for some time.

But data alone doesn't tell the full story. If you spend time with most emerging artists, they'll tell you about the community that supports them and drives them to keep creating, despite the financial pitfalls of being a musician in 2025.

Loading Instagram content

In a perfect world, there would be a clear path to a sustainable career as a musician in Australia. That is not currently the case.

At their best, music conferences like BIGSOUND, which took place in Brisbane this week, offer the industry a space to interrogate, unpack and work on solutions for big issues facing Australian artists.

At their worst, they're a place for those in the industry — but not on the stage — to scheme ways of extracting more value from those they work with.

Ultimately, things tend to land somewhere in the middle. Well-meaning managers, promoters, journalists, venue bookers and more, spend the days wringing their hands and hoping for a better way forward.

Confronting these realities is often frustrating, sometimes even upsetting. Whether progress happens depends on who you ask, and what they stand to gain.

BIGSOUND unveils its bumper 2025 line-up Photo shows Three close up photos of two women in darkened green rooms and one young man with a blue sky and the ocean We're yearning for Spring and here's a big sniff of it: BIGSOUND is gearing up to take over Meanjin/Brisbane's Fortitude Valley again.

As the Sun sets, everyone's attention turns to the dozen or so stages hosting over 200 artists playing country, hip hop, folk, metal, jazz, pop, rock — just about anything you could imagine.

Most acts who make it to BIGSOUND are already at a level where they're ready to launch into the next phase. They're both good enough and eager enough to make this their profession, if the pathways existed.

Seeing so much great music is hugely heartening as a music lover, though the high standard across the board makes picking a handful of stand-outs practically impossible.

Here are five artists who stood out at BIGSOUND, and who represent the strength and diversity of Australian music today.

You may not see them on the charts any time soon — or maybe we will as we see eligibility criteria change — but they prove quality isn't to blame for Australian music's crisis.

Mariae Cassandra (WA, pop)

Hear her on triple j Unearthed

Her first couple of songs, released last year, make it clear that young Western Australian singer-songwriter Mariae Cassandra is a special talent. Last year's triple j Unearthed High winner's performance at BIGSOUND confirms that early promise.

Both naturally confident and disarmingly humble, Cassandra's endearing charm makes for a magnetic performance, that charm bested only by the quality of her voice and the deftly executed bedroom pop songs she writes.

Loading Instagram content

Even playing acoustic and unaccompanied in a room filled with chatterboxes, her excellence shines through as those emotive songs soar, and her voice cuts through the din. It's easy to imagine how unstoppable she'll be when backed by a band.

Drizzz (NSW, hip hop)

Hear him on triple j Unearthed

From one Unearthed High winner to another, 16-year-old Sydney rapper Drizzz drops into BIGSOUND for a last-minute surprise set just two weeks after winning the national high school competition.

Loading Instagram content

While he shows talent comparable to the biggest and best MCs in the game, what makes the UK drill-influenced rapper even more gripping is that he writes from his own perspective. His bars are about being young and smashing people's low expectations. They speak to his visions for a big future. They explore the frustrations of young desire.

While he can already stand toe-to-toe with much older MCs, the fact he's not trying to be anyone but himself is what makes him most compelling.

Tyla Rodrigues (Qld, country)

Hear her on YouTube

Unless you've been snoozing under a stetson for the past few years, you know that country music is having a serious moment.

Australia continues to punch above its weight in terms of quality of artists, and emerging Brisbane singer-songwriter Tyla Rodrigues stands out as a prominent future flag-bearer for our take on the style. She shows great promise, and her star power is now easier to see than ever.

Her first BIGSOUND set draws a modest crowd but would have worked on a festival main stage. The way she spoke about her songs makes us feel connected to her and her stories, while from a musical standpoint there are no notes to give: her fantastic band never gets in the way of Rodrigues's storytelling.

Drifting Clouds (NT, various genres)

Drifting Clouds is a new project helmed by Terry Guyula, conceived in his homeland of Bunhungura. (Supplied)

Hear them on triple j Unearthed

If you haven't heard Bunhungura outfit Drifting Clouds' debut single Bawuypawuy, please do so immediately. It's one of the best songs of the year.

It's the only song that Terry Guyula, who helms the project, has released, and his show on BIGSOUND's final night suggests that it gives just a glimpse of the breadth of what he'll deliver next.

Loading Instagram content

It's an alluring melange of pop, soft rock, house, country, calypso, and more, driven by Guyula's vibey keys and stunning voice. He sings in both Djambarrpuyngu and English, joining a growing line of artists keeping language alive. He's also an endearing presence on stage, engaging with the crowd between songs and clearly relishing the chance to share his work with music lovers.

Lucky (Vic, indie rock)

Lucky hails from Victorian town of Staghorn Flat and makes wonderfully noisy yet melodic indie rock.

Hear them on triple j Unearthed

While guitar-driven indie rock never goes out of style, its popularity among emerging artists comes in waves. We're currently cresting a particularly exciting one, and Lucky is one of the better proponents.

Loading Instagram content

The Staghorn Flat songwriter, who played with an excellent band, was one of the best surprise packages this BIGSOUND. Her take on guitar-driven alt-rock feels both fresh and familiar, with fuzzy, swirling guitars and immediate hooks that get you pumping your fist and singing along by the second chorus.

There's a nostalgic pull to these evocative songs, but rather than make us yearn for the past, they make us excited about the future.

"Talking Heads frontman David Byrne on new album Who Is The Sky? and joyful collaboration Nearly 50 years on from posing existential queries on Talking Heads' art-pop masterpiece Once In A Lifetime (""How did I get here?'… Am I right? Am I wrong?""), David Byrne is still asking lots of big questions.

Who Is The Sky? is the influential artist's first new album since 2018's American Utopia, which evolved into a raved-about tour, concert film, and Broadway production, earning Byrne a Tony Award to accompany his Oscar, Grammy, and Golden Globe.

The record's title is taken from a speech-to-text bungle of 'who is this guy?'

""I loved how it got changed into something cosmic, spiritual, and completely nonsensical,"" Byrne tells Double J's Karen Leng. ""And it sort of fits.

""The record cover is me half in disguise and the songs are asking lots of questions. Who am I? What is love? And why do we fall in love? So, it all kind of fits together.""

"" Maybe not providing enough answers but if you ask the right question, you're halfway there. ""

Hear David Byrne's interview with Double J Photo shows David Byrne 2025 Our favourite musical Talking Head is back with a brand new album.

This kind of curiosity is a crucial part of Byrne's songwriting process. After the acrimonious break-up of Talking Heads in 1991, that inquisitiveness transformed the nervy, nerdy frontman in the oversized business suit into a renaissance man who has embraced all walks of art.

He wrote and directed the 1986 film True Stories, authored the best-selling book How Music Works, and co-wrote the popular musical Here Lies Love with British producer Fatboy Slim, based on the life of Philippine shoe-obsessed first lady Imelda Marcos.

That is before considering a varied solo discography defined by multicultural collaboration, with everyone from Brian Eno and Australia's own Montaigne to Tropicalia figureheads Marisa Monte and Caetano Veloso.

A short history of Talking Heads A look inside one of the most fascinating bands of all time

Punk and the pandemic

Byrne joins the interview from the ""music room"" in his New York City home.

""It's a complete mess. There's guitars and half-finished lyrics everywhere … This is where the musical magic happens.""

Loading Instagram content

It was also the inspiration for My Apartment Is My Friend, a love song from his new album written after spending nearly two years locked in, cooking and drawing, during the pandemic.

""I don't mind being alone really, but I realised the apartment is my shelter. It's my safe space.""

Another stand-out, A Door Called No, begins as a quirky metaphor for discrimination before evolving into a triumphant, string-enhanced plea for unity — a unifying theme of Who Is The Sky?

""I was reading an interview with John Cameron Mitchell [playwright, actor, and director best known for Hedwig and the Angry Inch].

"" He said, 'the most punk thing you can do right now is empathy.' ""

Punk is historically associated with the stereotype of wild-haired anti-authoritarians performing short, fast, loud music.

But against the current climate of global conflict and societal division, it has become punk to embrace kindness and empathy. That ethos is at the heart — of all things — the new big-screen adaptation of Superman.

""I love that quote. Maybe that touches a little on what I'm after,"" says Byrne, who believes the world could use a lot more peace, love and understanding.

""Right now, it does."" Especially when ""powerful folks, like Elon Musk and others"", as Byrne points out, have described empathy as a weakness. ""I thought, well, OK, that's what we're dealing with.

""It is a bleak time. I know Australia has had its dealings with immigration at various points. It's a complicated issue; I won't say it's simple. But what's being done here [in the US] right now is cruel, and I think it's meant to be. It's a spectacle of cruelty that's being put on.""

Rather than directly comment on the seemingly perpetual chaos in politically charged anthems, Byrne aims to counteract the negativity with an overdose of positivity.

Infectiously joyful lead single Everybody Laughs sets the agenda for Who Is The Sky? — an album stocked with charmingly naive melodies and whimsical subject matter. The songs are characterised by colourful arrangements and rarely breach the three-and-a-half-minute mark.

""I didn't go in saying 'I'm going to write songs about this'. It just sort of happens,"" Byrne explains.

""Because I'm thinking 'What do I need to hear right now? What's going to make me feel better?' Not just in a superficial way but what's going to help me get through all this.

""You do it for yourself in some way and hope that it does it for other people too.""

Playing well with others

One of music's great collaborators, Byrne has expanded his horizons yet again on Who Is The Sky?, enlisting the services of Kid Harpoon, the British pop producer whose clients include Harry Styles, Miley Cyrus, and Jessie Ware.

He also reunited with longtime friend St. Vincent (""Annie lives very close to the studio I was working at"") and joined forces with Tom Skinner, revered drummer for The Smile and Sons of Kemet co-founder (""wonderful guy, he really did an incredible job"").

His most important recruits, however, are Ghost Train Orchestra. Byrne admired the 15-piece New York-based ensemble's interpretations of eccentric street poet and composer Moondog.

""They're kind of a chamber orchestra but they also have drums, guitar and bass, so they have elements of a pop band. I thought 'Oooh, maybe that's what these songs could sound like?'""

They are the proverbial house band to Byrne's musical party, incorporating his varied sonic tastes.

There is scope for a thumping dancehall pulse on The Truth, while the balmy I'm An Outsider effortlessly weaves together punctuated brass, vocoder, marimba, and surreal lyrics.

On The Avant Garde, wonky chords and jagged guitar dovetail into a charming chorus that succinctly mirrors Byrne's career as arguably pop music's most celebrated oddball, singing:

""It's deceptively weighty, profoundly absurd. Well, it's whatever fits. It's the Avant Garde, and it doesn't mean s**t.""

The searching What Is The Reason For It? is a mariachi horn-assisted, minor-key ramble where Byrne trades questions about the very nature of love with Paramore frontwoman Hayley Williams.

Byrne connected with Williams via a tribute album to accompany last year's re-release of the iconic Talking Heads concert film Stop Making Sense.

""There were a few [covers] that took big liberties with the songs and really re-interpreted them. Those were some of my favourites because when I listen to them, I go, 'Oh, that gives a completely new meaning to that song.'""

It has helped Byrne reach a younger generation, a situation that peaked with him recently joining pop sensation Olivia Rodrigo at the Governor's Ball festival to perform Burning Down The House.

The anthropologist from Mars

At 73, Byrne has welcomed what he calls a ""don't-give-a-shit-about-what-people-think attitude,"" which has manifested in a playful self-awareness that is both insightful and sometimes deeply silly.

There is a moment on When We Are Singing where Byrne gleefully yelps about having ""one foot in the pearly gates and one foot in the flames"" then bursts into comic, wordless vocalisations.

As its title suggests, I Met The Buddha at a Downtown Party is a bit of Beatlesque whimsy where Byrne engages the titular deity scoffing down pastries and lamenting retiring ""from that enlightenment biz. I don't have the answers, and I never did.""

Byrne says relying on a strong premise, no matter how preposterous, is a good songwriting technique. And ""inevitably, it goes into something where you start revealing parts of yourself,"" he adds sagely.

Case in point: Moisturising Thing skewers youth fetishism through a bizarre tale where Byrne is transformed into a baby by a magic lotion offered by his fiancee, 55-year-old businesswoman and artist Mala Gaonkar.

David Byrne and Mala Gaonkar have collaborated on multiple artistic projects. (Reuters: Andrew Kelly)

The pair were married this week — guests enjoyed an instrumental playlist curated by Byrne — and Gaonkar is a recurring presence on Who Is The Sky?

The jaunty, bossy Don't Be Like That is addressed to her, while She Explains Things To Me is a cheeky flip on mansplaining where Gaonkar unpacks film and TV plots and poetry for her hapless husband.

""She explains the things that we're supposed to infer. Well, how come it's all so obvious to her?""

It's a microcosm of Byrne's talent for mining mountains of meaning from seemingly mundane molehills, examining ordinary human behaviours and elevating them with a sense of wonder.

""I tend to be — as someone once said — a little bit of an anthropologist from Mars. As if I'm visiting the human [race] and going 'Oh look, they do this and they do that!,"" he remarks with a Dr. Seuss-ian rhythm.

""They laugh and they cry, they live and they die. They eat and they dance.""

As such, Byrne's work ""doesn't leave out the sad or negative, but it still becomes a celebration of what it means to be human.""

"How Bob Dylan captivated a generation LAURA TINGLE, PRESENTER: It was one of the most iconic moments in 1960s music - the night Bob Dylan came on stage at the Newport folk festival and played an electric set to the consternation and anger of his audience.

It was a far cry from the folk roots from which he had emerged. Championed by the likes of Pete Saeger and Joan Baez.

It is now the dramatic high point of a new movie about Dylan's early years from director James Mangold and starring Timothee Chalamet.

Timothee Chalamet and James Mangold, welcome to 7.30.

JAMES MANGOLD, DIRECTOR: Thank you, great to be here.

TIMOTHEE CHALAMET, ACTOR: Thank you, thank you having us.

LAURA TINGLE: The dramatic climax of the film is Bob Dylan's decision to play an electric set at Newport. Why do you believe that was such a significant moment?

JAMES MANGOLD: I believe it was a significant moment in retrospect. People look back, afterwards and identify how much the early ‘60s changed.

How the late '60s are very different, more raucous, unruly, rock'n'roll, Woodstock, Vietnam, RFK's assassination, the ever-increasing fear of nuclear mutual destruction. That was all really the late '60s and the early '60s were a harbinger of it and I can see people identifying this concert as a kind of turning point.

LAURA TINGLE: They were momentous times in the world, but you can only imagine what a strange time it must have been for a young musician who was still only 24 in 1965. Trying to break into the human story and the musician's story was part of director James Mangold's ambition with the movie.

JAMES MANGOLD: We have to make a human moment happen that may have historical ramifications but none of the characters are aware in that moment they're making history, and that for me, it was much more important to get the feeling that Bob had to push away the confinements that he had been feeling, and embrace, you know, he had always wanted to play rock'n'roll ever since he was 13.

LAURA TINGLE: Bob Dylan has been universally famous for as long as many of us have been alive and universally famous, just as television took the experience to a whole new level.

But it was a different sort of fame to that experienced by the Beatles. The lyricism and power of Dylan's poetry galvanised young people. It was political. People saw significance in his every gesture, like this man.

REPORTER: I would like to know about the meaning of the photograph of you wearing the Triumph T-shirt.

BOB DYLAN: What do you want to know about it?

REPORTER: I want to know, it's equivalent photograph, it means something? It's got a philosophy in it.

I'd like to know visually what it represents to you, because you're a part of that.

BOB DYLAN: I haven't really looked at it that much.

REPORTER: I've thought about it a great deal.

LAURA TINGLE: Fame is still a wild phenomenon to negotiate. The young star of the movie, Timothee Chalamet confronts it himself. Bob Dylan has found his own ways of coping with the immensity of his fame over the years, but a fascinating aspect of this new movie is that it portrays him of something as an invention from the moment he first arrives in New York.

(Excerpt from movie - A Complete Unknown)

LAURA TINGLE: Timothee, your character says that people make up their past, and even when we first see him arrive in New York, he tells people this implausible story about how he used to work in a carnival. Did he feel elusive to you when you were trying to work out how you would play this character?

TIMOTHEE CHALAMET: Well, as you so wonderfully put it, this is the interpretation of Bob Dylan. The real man is alive and well in Malibu, California, so he could give you a better answer than I could.

James Mangold put together a script that sort of was unconventional, in that it is about a young man, a young artist, whose career takes off quite quickly, who is quite gifted from the jump. And is absent of the tropes of realities and more classic biopics or classic stories of young struggle.

LAURA TINGLE: There's a certain Life of Brian madness to Bob Dylan's life in those early years. It's not just screaming girls. People actually thought that he was the Messiah. Do you think that the character you portrayed in the film reflected that madness? Or was it that was what he always was?

JAMES MANGOLD: Well, it's probably a little bit of each. You know, we're not the man, so we're only left to make artistic conjecture.

It seems to me that it is very possible that a young artist can be completely prepared to deliver gobsmackingly poetic art to a public, but not necessarily be ready for the gigantically adoring response to that art.

Those are two entirely different psychological profiles - the ability to handle people considering you a prophet or a Messiah or just a superstar, or just adoring you and the very private, personal, meditative zen like act of making art.

TIMOTHEE CHALAMET: I think Jim does that primarily through the eyes of other characters. The wonderful Elle Fanning plays Sylvie Russo, Boyd Holbrook does a wonderful job playing Johnny Cash. Edward Norton, Pete Seger, Monica Barbero plays Joan Baez. Just fantastic. I think that the key to what you're describing is really seeing how Bob Dylan affects those around him in the film, the character of Bob Dylan and seeing what their impact is on him.

(Excerpt from movie - A Complete Unknown)

LAURA TINGLE: Talking about the way that others saw Bob Dylan. Joan Baez certainly has a rather a frank assessment of Bob Dylan during the film. What do you think the other characters do tell us about the Bob Dylan that you're creating in the movie?

JAMES MANGOLD: Well, I think that they tell us many things. A movie isn't static, and a role isn't static. It's actually a temporal art form. So you're moving moment to moment through different feelings.

One can be in love with someone, and fascinated and even charmed by someone, and think they're a bit of an asshole.

These things can all be true and that gives Monica in that moment a chance to play many colours. To be, you know, to be fascinated by his blunt human cruelty, but at the same time, to be completely charmed by it, because she lives in a world of bullshit and endless praise.

Too often when we talk about movies in print or even among ourselves, we talk about them as static things. But the characters are one thing in the first ten minutes and another in the middle hour, and another thing in the end, and that's true for all of them if they're alive, in the movie. And so, it becomes hard, because you know, as Bob says, I contain multitudes.

LAURA TINGLE: He certainly does and so does the movie. Thank you so much to both of you for talking to us tonight.

"From NYC to Hong Kong: AFL grand final goes global with watch parties around the world Saturday’s AFL grand final at the MCG will attract a crowd more than 30,000 fans larger than that of the next Super Bowl. It will be preceded by a public holiday for the prematch parade – one of the few days off around the world dedicated to sport. And it will be headlined by Snoop Dogg, one of earth’s pre-eminent musical performers.

By these measures, the grand final can stand alongside any event in world sport. But while there may be more than 50 watch parties for this weekend’s match scheduled across the globe, including five in China and six in Germany, the sport’s international growth remains a work in progress.

Michael “Magic” Murphy, the president of the New York Magpies, Manhattan’s Australian rules club, says more than 500 people will attend this year’s watch party where first bounce will be cheered just after midnight.

About 40% of the club’s players are locals, and Murphy – who was introduced to the sport by his American college girlfriend and now wife Andrea Casillas, also an ex-president of the club – has become an advocate for the sport.

“Oftentimes people just think it’s rugby, they have a better understanding of rugby in the US, and its reach is a little bit wider, so explaining to them it’s not rugby and that it’s a whole different code, and that it moves more like soccer and it’s higher scoring and more exciting are typically things that pique their interest,” he says.

American sports broadcaster Pat McAfee has become the AFL’s most prominent fan in the US after discovering the code during the pandemic. He visited the Gabba last month and caught up with the Brisbane Lions.

Given the growing dominance of Australian punters in college football, McAfee’s liking for the game can be understood, but Murphy has found other Americans can be more difficult to convince. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it, it’s always hard to compete with other sports here that are more well known in the US,” Murphy says.

To help his case, Murphy will often reach for his phone. “Everyone is always astonished by someone jumping on someone else’s back and catching a mark, so that’s always a good one to pull out, the top ten [highlights], marks of the year, goals of the year are also pretty good,” he says. “We’ve also got [Collingwood’s American player] Mason Cox who’s out there now doing his stuff, he’s been a little bit of a boon.”

Aishling Moloney, Geelong’s AFLW full forward from Tipperary, says AFL grand final week in Australia is bigger than an All-Ireland final back home, the traditional climax of the Irish sporting calendar. “Coming from home, an All-Ireland final is a big week for us, so to experience a grand final week, it’s just absolutely amazing,” she says. “You just don’t want this to end, it’s absolutely incredible, and I’m delighted to eventually get to see it and feel it and visualise it.”

While the NRL appears committed to its annual visit to Las Vegas and increasing support for the international game especially in the Pacific, the AFL’s pursuit of elite competition overseas appears to have been put on the backburner. Its experiment taking premiership matches to China ended in 2019, though head office continues to support grassroots participation overseas through bodies such as AFL Europe and AFL Asia.

At last month’s AFL Asian Championships in Thailand, the Hong Kong Dragons won three of the five competitions. Hongkonger Brenda Chan, a sustainability consultant, has been with the club for six years having previously played rugby and Gaelic football. “I enjoy the physical side of [Australian rules football] compared to Gaelic,” she says. “It’s a very good balance, and I also enjoy the fitness side.”

Roughly half the Dragons are Australian expats, but Chan says there is an increasing number of locals, especially within the women’s ranks. “In the last two or three years we’ve got a lot more Asians, quite some Hong Kong people, some from mainland China. That’s one of the things I really enjoyed a lot with the Hong Kong Dragons because it’s a very diverse group of people and it’s also very inclusive.”

Chan will attend her first AFL grand final party this weekend with the club, where more than 100 people are expected to enjoy the match alongside a buffet and drinks. She says before she played Australian rules football, she didn’t have many Australian friends. “Getting to know the Australians in the club, talking with them, playing with them, you get a sense of what Australia’s culture and the people are like, which I really enjoy.”

So the Australians are OK? “They are more than OK.”",From NYC to Hong Kong: AFL grand final goes global with watch parties around the world,sports,Jack Snape,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/25/afl-2025-grand-final-goes-global-snoop-dog-half-time-performance,2025-09-25 00:00:00,"The AFL grand final is set to attract over 30,000 fans at the MCG, with watch parties scheduled globally, including in New York and Hong Kong.

"From the Pocket: blunt and brilliant Chris Scott is master of a job few have done better “This job changes you,” Chris Scott tells author Anson Cameron in his book, Neil Balme: A Tale of Two Men. “It has the real potential to negatively affect your life. Neil used to say to me, ‘Don’t let this turn you into a maniac.’ I mean, I respect Bomber as a coach. But what did it do to him?”

The book is full of fantastic little nuggets like that. Nathan Buckley’s thoughts on Mick Malthouse warrants its own column. So does Cameron’s sketch of Eddie McGuire: “A man who can scan a room and rank everyone it in from greatest to least before he blinks, a mix of blokeish bonhomie and clear analytical smarts, a man to be reckoned with.”

Even as a schoolboy, Scott was a pitiless footballer. He terrorised his opponents for years. But the game itself tortured him. The more his body let him down, and the more his team began to struggle, the more obsessive he became about how he trained and what he ate. His only thought when the final siren blew was, “Thank God that’s over.” He was adamant that football would play no further role in his career or life.

Naturally, within a couple of months, he was an assistant coach at Fremantle. He resolved to make footy as stress-free as possible for his players, but it was still all-consuming for him. He’d stew for days after losses, barely sleeping. After the 2022 grand final, he sat alone in a meeting room, his head in his hands, and let out an almighty bellow. “It felt like breathing out for the first time in 10 years,” he said.

View image in fullscreen Chris Scott is usually a closed book when it comes to his team. Photograph: Daniel Pockett/Getty Images

It’s rare for Scott to let us in like that. “He talks a lot, but he doesn’t say anything,” Adam Simpson said last week. Ross Lyon will shuffle into a press conference and totally unbidden will give you a dossier on how the opposition just played. Good luck getting anything similar out of Scott. He’s a thoughtful voice on many of the broader issues surrounding the game. But when it comes to his own team, the drawbridge goes up. He gently flicks the reporters down to fine leg. He never talks about the fans the way Craig McRae does.

He doesn’t speak the language of Harvard leadership courses. He speaks the language of Leigh Matthews. He has a way of structuring his answers to make the questioner and the viewer come away thinking they have no idea whatsoever. “I could understand why you would think that but …” Or, “I could be wrong, but …” Or “I’m not going to explain that to you right now.” In many ways, it’s a reasonable approach to the necessary evil of the post-match press conference.

He’s also reluctant to talk about himself. He gave the annual MCC oration about eight years ago and agreed to the Howie Games podcast during the depths of Covid. And that’s about it. Mark Howard broached the subject of Scott’s father, Colin, who flew helicopters in the Vietnam war, being awarded a distinguished flying cross for rescuing American soldiers behind enemy lines. When Chris and Brad Scott were eight, Colin had an asthma attack walking to a local store and died. He was 41. His mum was an English teacher who took over the family news agency and with the help of Legacy put her five children through private school.

Both twins speak in awe of their mum. And both, just like McRae, just like Michael Voss and just like everyone who was coached by him, always defer to the coaching philosophies of Matthews. Scott shares his even temperament, his bluntness, his total absence of jargon, and his ability to distil complex information. And though he wasn’t as destructive as Matthews on the field, those who meet either of them for the first time are always surprised to reconcile the affable, analytical man with the athlete from their playing days.

View image in fullscreen Patrick Dangerfield and Chris Scott after winning their 2020 preliminary final against Brisbane. Photograph: Michael Willson/AFL Photos/Getty Images

Half a decade ago, he was criticised for squandering his potential and being too wedded to his gameplan. Look at the savage response after the 2019 and 2021 preliminary finals. A lot of that came from Geelong supporters, because he’d never let them in, and because frankly they’d had it too good for too long, there was resentment. That changed when he won the premiership in 2022, and especially heading into the 2024 preliminary final. Suddenly he was spoken about as the best coach in the land – relaxed, whip smart, the man who was doing the most with the least.

Balme warned him against turning into a maniac. And judging by his Krakatoa acts early in his career, you’d swear he wasn’t temperamentally suited to the role. But every person who’s worked with him or played under him – even the ones he sacked – insist they never saw him lose his cool, raise his voice or berate a player. After the reverse free kick in the qualifying final, as pandemonium raged around him, he just sat there like a chess master – the master of a job he never saw himself doing, a job he’s sometimes hinted at leaving, a job he says isn’t healthy, and a job that few have done better.",From the Pocket: blunt and brilliant Chris Scott is master of a job few have done better,sports,Jonathan Horn,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/24/from-the-pocket-blunt-and-brilliant-chris-scott-is-master-of-a-job-few-have-done-better,2025-09-24 00:00:00,"Chris Scott, the coach of Geelong, reflects on the pressures and challenges of his role in a new book about Neil Balme, revealing his struggles with the game and his obsessive nature regarding performance.

"Parochialism or just vibes? How to pick a team to cheer for in the AFL grand final The AFL grand final is here, and 16 fanbases are out in the cold once again. The Brisbane Lions are looking to go back-to-back, the Geelong Cats are looking to stop them, and an army of neutral, casual and undecided fans face the eternal question: which of these two teams do I dislike less?

There’s no overwhelming sentimental favourite in this year’s decider. Brisbane and Geelong are two of the premier teams of the last five years. Whoever wins, no historic title drought will break. So how does an AFL bandwagoner pick a band to wagon? It might come down to regional parochialism, to recognition of dominance, or to simple vibes.

Geelong Cats

As a football club, Geelong’s pedigree is undeniable. The 166-year-old club has a storied history, as much a part of Victoria’s second city as the Eldritch-horror bollards that dot its waterfront.

Perhaps due to their regional roots, Geelong don’t quite inspire the same loathing as some of the more divisive Melbourne-based teams (hello, Collingwood). Captained by the delightfully-named Patrick Dangerfield and with a logo that resembles a children’s-book villain, it’s hard to truly hate a team that feels, at least in part, like it fell out of an Enid Blyton novel.

Which isn’t to say that the Cats should be underestimated. They have been a perennial contender for the past 20 years, missing the finals only three times since 2005. Despite losing star defender Tom Stewart to a head injury in their victory over Hawthorn on Friday, and going up against the defending premiers, Geelong enter the grand final as favourites. They’re only three years removed from their last premiership and emphatically put Brisbane in their place in week one of the finals. If any team can keep the Lions from going back-to-back, the Cats can.

View image in fullscreen Bailey Smith takes a selfie with fans. Photograph: Morgan Hancock/Getty Images

Geelong also have one of the more colourful fans of any sporting franchise anywhere: Troy West, aka Catman, whose full-body cat getups are either laudably committed or existentially horrifying, depending on your outlook on life.

Barrack for if: You think Halle Berry’s Catwoman was criminally underrated.

Barrack against if: You can’t get the expressions on those bollards out of your head.

Brisbane Lions

There was no guarantee that an AFL team would survive long-term in Australia’s most rugby league-mad city, but since forcibly relocating from Fitzroy in 1997, the Lions rapidly established themselves as a fierce, aggressive outfit more than capable of holding their own. Three premierships from 2001 to 2003 set the Lions up for enduring success and made them a source of pride in Brisbane, rather than the affectionate embarrassment their predecessors, the Bears, inspired.

After a drought of more than 20 years, including a torrid near-decade at the wrong end of the ladder, the Lions nabbed their fourth premiership in their Brisbane incarnation last year. Sunday will be their third grand final appearance in a row, and their bruising wins over the Gold Coast and Collingwood to claw their way back into finals contention suggest they’re up for the contest. Backing the reigning premiers to win again isn’t exactly a bold choice, but Brisbane’s eternal outsider status – and dogged excellence in spite of it – mean they win a grudging respect from plenty of neutrals.

A note of caution for would-be bandwagoners who don’t hail from the Sunshine State: if the Lions win, and their cross-code counterparts the Brisbane Broncos win the NRL grand final in two weekends’ time, the level of Queensland-supremacist chauvinism on display may genuinely lead to secession. At the very least, it’ll be extremely annoying.

"Stars align as AFLW stalwarts Ebony Marinoff and Ally Anderson become first to reach 100-game milestone Time moves a little differently in the AFLW. Between game length, shorter seasons, and a fixture with a history of moving about, timing is so often a point of contention.

Sometimes, however, the timing is exactly right.

This Sunday, Adelaide Crows captain, Ebony Marinoff, will lead her team out on to the Unley Oval turf. When she does, it will be her 100th time running out for an AFLW game – a personal marker never before reached in this competition, now 10 seasons old and nine years in. It’s a remarkable, hard-fought moment, and its significance is not lost on Marinoff. The milestone coincides with Adelaide’s 100th game in the league, meaning that Marinoff has featured in every single one of their games.

“It’s an awesome milestone to be a part of,” she says. “You’ve got to pinch yourself, but also soak it up because it’s pretty cool.”

Yet, remarkably, Marinoff and Adelaide won’t be alone in this achievement. Ally Anderson, the Brisbane Lions stalwart and fellow inaugural player, will also be hitting her 100-game milestone on Sunday – similarly coinciding with Brisbane’s 100th AFLW game.

Symmetry aside, it’s not something Anderson ever imagined for herself when she debuted. “After the first year, I took some photos in the change rooms because I was like, ‘Ah, [I’m] probably not going to play again, this was just a one-off thing,’” Anderson says. “The fact that I’m here nine years later is really crazy.”

In an inspired move from the league, Adelaide and Brisbane are scheduled to play in their separate games at 3.05pm AEST, ensuring that both players will be notching up their centuries at the very same moment, in front of their respective home crowds.

“We had a photo together a couple of weeks ago and we were both like, ‘oh, it’s a bit early,’” Anderson says. “To have this milestone with her is pretty special, and it’s cool that we get to do it together.”

Marinoff thinks the symbolism is fitting. “We’ve got kind of similar stories,” she says. “Well, very different stories, but the sustained success and the loyalty that we’ve both had to our clubs – it seems like a really nice story for us to both make history.”

Anderson admits there’s “a bit of luck involved” in avoiding major injury, especially in a competition so prone to it. However, she credits her club’s medical team – many also slated to hit 100 games across the coming rounds – for their elite work, further reflected in Brisbane captain Bre Koenen sitting on 97 games (alongside North Melbourne’s Libby Birch).

Adding to the poetry is the fact that Anderson and Marinoff are both one-club players, a pinnacle of consistency in a league perhaps better known for player movement. While much of this churn has been due to expansion-related list reshuffling, a smattering of high-profile players opt to move for more altruistic reasons, bolstering newer or struggling clubs to raise the standard of the competition. Both approaches, club-building and league-building alike, have been vital.

“I have a real understanding of what it’s taken to grow the game,” Marinoff says. “You see the influence that so many stars have had across the game if they’ve moved clubs … you thank them for that, because if those players hadn’t moved or taken up opportunities, I don’t think the league would be in the position that it is. So I think you have to respect that part of it. But for me, it’s been amazing to be at this footy club since day dot, and it’s something that I’m very proud of.”

Marinoff and Anderson have each embraced the opportunity afforded them, becoming instrumental in shaping club culture alongside other inaugural players. Their teams have never had to exist without them; they are woven into the very fabric of their clubs, and the passion and perseverance that got them this far is engrained into their clubs’ DNA. The results – premierships, finals appearances, and dozens of personal accolades – speak for themselves.

But for all the success on paper, their ultimate legacy may just lie in what they’ve built. “What’s been most impressive over the last few years is we’ve had a lot of young girls come in,” Marinoff explains. “And I feel like if you look at our group now, we’ve got so many important young leaders stepping up and creating a culture that they want to be a part of.”

Anderson reports the same at Brisbane. “You’ve got the younger girls who have come in after me … they’re incredible leaders in their own right,” she says. “I’m looking up to them even though they’re younger than me.”

Time may move a little differently in the AFLW, but it’s that very difference that allows for moments of brilliance like this. Never missing a game on the journey to 100 is an astonishing enough achievement; to not miss a game in 10 seasons is something else entirely, and it is well worth pausing to celebrate.

Come Sunday, however, there will be just one thing on their minds – the same thing that has driven their success for close to a decade.

“As soon as that siren goes, I’m fully focused on the game and getting the job done,” Anderson says.

Marinoff agrees: “Honestly? Just win.”

"Want AFL grand final tickets? Go and watch the AFLW Geelong Cats and Brisbane Lions fans have been given one final opportunity to secure a seat at the grand final, as the AFL looks to leverage the scarcity of tickets for its showpiece event to boost crowds at AFLW games.

Thousands of fans have been left disappointed following member ballot draws, which gave 17,500 tickets to the fans of each club. Melbourne Cricket Club members have been allocated 22,500 tickets and about 20,000 have been provided to AFL and Medallion Club members.

The remainder is given to the AFL and its partners, and head office has decided to offer five double passes worth more than $1,000 each as part of a new AFLW promotion this year.

The AFLW general manager, Emma Moore, said she wants “as many fans as possible” to attend an AFLW game this season. “This competition is a terrific opportunity for fans to get to a match and have the chance to win a precious AFL grand final ticket,” she said.

Five women’s games will be held in Melbourne and Geelong on Thursday night and Friday, as the AFL tries to tap into the Victorian public holiday and the general enthusiasm around the code. At three-quarter time in each game, one double pass will be handed out in a meat raffle-style draw for fans who attend.

According to an AFL Fans Association poll of 5,645 people run on its social channels this year, 92% of respondents wanted more grand final tickets reserved for competing club members. The organisation is lobbying for an allocation of 20,000 for each club.

Thursday night’s game at GMHBA pits the Cats against the Hawks, and will be the start of three days of celebrations for Geelong fans. The AFLW team has now won three games in a row and has surged into the top eight.

“[The AFLW team is] playing some really good football the last three weeks and getting a big crowd along to support the women’s team is going to be awesome,” Cats men’s forward Jeremy Cameron said.

“Having the day off the next day for the parade is even more reason to come along and watch tomorrow night, so we hope for a big crowd and we’ll cheer them on for another win.”

Debra Ayres and her teenage daughter Kerrigan visited GMHBA stadium on Wednesday to watch the Geelong players train. They have never been to an AFLW game, but upon hearing of the possibility of winning grand final tickets, they were considering going on Thursday night.

“We used to live near [Whitten] Oval in Footscray, but we never got there,” Debra said. “It was always bad weather on the night we planned to go, but if it’s going to be good weather tomorrow night, we might come down, we’ve got nothing planned.”

She said the ticket giveaway definitely influenced her decision: “I’ve never been to a grand final, we only go to Marvel stadium in the city.”

A crowd of 2,771 came to last year’s pre-grand final Thursday night game which is becoming a tradition in Geelong, and the club hopes that will be exceeded in part due to the promotion.

AFLW crowds this season are averaging about 2,500 a match, well short of the benchmark of 6,000 required to trigger a longer season that is written into the collective bargaining agreement.

The 8,042 that attended the opener between Carlton and Collingwood remains the highest attendance of the year, but the Sydney derby on Sunday drew 7,171.",Want AFL grand final tickets?

"‘It was hectic’: Memories of the last time the Wallabies won at Eden Park in 1986 If “it’s the hope that kills you” then Wallabies fans have been dying a slow death for 39 years at Eden Park, the venue for this Saturday’s first Test of the Bledisloe Cup.

The Auckland venue is the All Blacks’ fortress. They have not lost there since 1994 and are unbeaten across 51 Tests (49 wins, two draws). No Australian team has won at Eden Park since the 1986 side led by Andrew Slack and coached by Alan Jones.

“It’s not so much Eden Park,” says Slack. “The House of Pain at Carisbrook and Death Valley at Dunedin are just as scary. The hardest thing is you’re always playing the All Blacks. But this year we’ve got an extremely realistic chance of winning.”

Plenty agree. New Zealand are coming off their worst Test defeat, a 43-10 whipping by South Africa whereas a resurgent Australia lead the Rugby Championship. Can these Wallabies end the Eden Park hoodoo and win a first Bledisloe in 23 years?

“Beating the All Blacks in their own backyard is what all Wallabies dream of,” says Simon Poidevin, flanker in the 1986 side. “But doing it at Eden Park – the beating heart of New Zealand rugby and the cathedral of all their dreams – well, that’s the ultimate.”

In the decade before the 1986 tour, Australia was beating the All Blacks regularly. They won a one-off Test for the Bledisloe in 1979 and backed it up with a 2-1 series win in 1980. But one-point defeats had cost them dearly in the 1984 and 1985 series.

“We knew we were their equal so those wasted opportunities made us hungrier,” says Slack. “After ‘84 we went to Europe and beat the home nations to win a Grand Slam. By the time we arrived in Wellington for the first Test, we were ready.”

Buoyed by a telegram from Sir Donald Bradman (“It’s a very big occasion. Good luck.”), the Wallabies won 13-12. But in Dunedin that scoreline was reversed after a controversial refereeing call denied Wallabies No 8 Steve Tuynman a late try.

“That was the quietest dressing room I’ve ever been in,” says Poidevin. “We knew that call had cost us a chance to go 2-0 up and clinch it.” Rookie Andrew Leeds, a reserve fullback in that Test, says, “you could’ve heard a pin drop. We were gutted.”

Slack recalls an interviewer asking him if the two 13-12 scorelines meant anything. “No,” he deadpans. “In my defence, we were shattered… and Jonesy had promised us five-days skiing if we locked up the series 2-0. You know, I’ve still never been skiing.”

Coach Jones didn’t let his Wallabies wallow. “Before we’d even checked into the hotel the next day, Jonesy had us working,” says Poidevin. “When the locals protested, he rounded up a few cars and got them to point their headlights onto the training field.”

The 1986 tour was a seven-week tour of three Tests and 11 torrid mid-week games. “It was my third tour of New Zealand and there’s no easy games there,” Slack says. “But we all felt privileged to be with our mates in the service of Australian rugby.”

The ‘86 tourists were a happy mob. “There were some pretty awesome toga parties,” says Leeds. “We played twice a week, celebrated twice a week and took advantage of all the hospitality the New Zealanders showed us. It would’ve been rude not to.”

Steinlager was beer sponsor for the series and a palette of cans was at every pitstop. Warm welcome or attempted sabotage? “Probably both,” laughs Poidevin. “But we could tuck in because we were fantastically fit and hardened for battle.”

The test of that came at Eden Park on 6 September. The Wallabies were all over the front pages for walking out of a hotel because it had one shower for a squad of 30. “Alan blew up,” says Slack. “But we barely noticed. We had total focus on the Test.”

They needed it, as the home side launched a blitzkrieg of attacking rugby. “The All Blacks style in those days was to dominate you upfront, kick for the corners and shred you on the ground,” says centre Brett Papworth. “It was stolid but it worked.”

Leeds’ form had won him a Test debut at fullback, shifting David Campese to wing. “As the new boy, I was expecting a barrage of bombs but they came out and ran it instead. It was hectic. Their plan was to blow us off the park in the first 20 minutes.”

Even in his 40th Test Poidevin was stunned. “Usually Bledisloes are trench warfare: you bash us, we bash you. This was different. Full-on pace. They were using the ball and going wide. Eden Park was roaring. We knew we were in for a Test and a half.”

But the Australians weathered the storm. “Cowboy [Mark] Shaw ran over the top of me but I hung on,” recalls Papworth. “And every time they rushed at us we had the numbers. After half an hour of frantic footy, everyone was knackered and some errors crept in.”

The turning point was a goal-line tackle by Wallabies prop Enrique Rodríguez. “When Topo [Rodríguez] hit Hika Reid,” says Papworth, “we all lifted and they all deflated.” Slack agrees. “Defence is attitude and that back-slam tackle encapsulated our attitude.”

The Wallabies went into half-time on that note, 12-6 ahead after a zig-zagging Papworth dash had set up Leeds’ first try. Ultimately Australia charged home 22-9. “The ‘84 Grand Slam had been a magical mystery tour but ‘86 was another level,” says Poidevin. “Winning was the most sensational feeling. Eden Park fell silent that day.”

Slack rates the victory above the historic slam of triumphs over England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. “The achievement and the quality of performances was better,” he says. “There is no greater satisfaction for a Wallaby than beating the All Blacks.”

Papworth and Leeds played on another year as amateurs, then went to rugby league. “But I never toured with a happier family than the 86ers,” he says. “Eden Park was my greatest day as a footballer.” Papworth can’t argue. “It’s in my heart forever.”

Can the 2025 Wallabies emulate the feat? “They’ve got the self-belief,” says Poidevin. “And they’ve dug themselves out of dark places before to win.” At Eden Park, the darkest of all, the path to victory is simple, says Papworth: “Back yourself and go.”",‘It was hectic’: Memories of the last time the Wallabies won at Eden Park in 1986,sports,Angus Fontaine,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/24/memories-of-1986-the-last-time-wallabies-beat-all-blacks-at-eden-park,2025-09-24 00:00:00,"Wallabies fans reflect on the team's last victory at Eden Park in 1986, a venue where Australia has not won since, as they prepare for the upcoming Bledisloe Cup Test.

"Why RGB-MiniLED just stole OLED’s quality crown Choosing a new TV typically means weighing up screen size, brightness, and how you plan to use it. QLED, mini-LED, and OLED technologies each has benefits and drawbacks, but a newcomer might be about to edge them all out of the competition.

RGB-MiniLED is striking a balance between the picture quality of OLED and the brightness and burn-in avoidance of mini-LED. The right TV for you? Maybe this is it.

The trouble with OLED

OLED has dominated over the past decade but its performance has always come with caveats. While it has incredible capacity for the blackest blacks and precision contrast, to perform at its best OLED needs dark rooms and minimal glare. OLED technology can also suffer from logos and screen graphics leaving permanent “burn-in” marks on the screen. It’s a risky choice for fans of sports and video games, where standardised graphics remain on fixed screen positions for extended periods.

The LED TV category has evolved significantly in recent years, consistently finding ways to improve backlighting systems to maintain its brightness advantage while improving its local area dimming systems and colour accuracy. Previous updates across mini-LED and quantum dot (QLED) technologies introduced thousands of individual backlights. Now, RGB-MiniLED is a breakthrough that achieves the best of OLED without the drawbacks.

Is RGB-MiniLED better than OLED?

Standard mini-LED uses blue backlights that are adjusted to become red or green as required, but RGB-MiniLED has pure red, green and blue LEDs for richer colours, higher brightness and better contrast.

Hisense’s flagship, 116-inch TV model, the RGB-MiniLED 116UX, is Australia’s largest RGB-MiniLED TV for domestic consumers (as of July 2025). The massive screen achieves up to 8,000 nits peak brightness while delivering 95% coverage of the expansive BT.2020 colour gamut, a benchmark designed for high dynamic range content experiences.

This combination of colour and brightness means picture quality is never compromised. Whether you’re watching movies at night or the cricket on a bright summer afternoon, your TV will always look its best, which can’t always be said for OLED. Add the Anti-Reflection PRO surface design on the Hisense screen and its AI Chroma Light Sensor for monitoring and responding to ambient light to maintain image accuracy, and you have the ideal TV for every living room, no matter the time of day.

Burn-in risk is not a problem for RGB-MiniLED, and the Hisense 116-inch screen features native 165Hz variable refresh rate, so video games can sync with the screen for ultra-smooth gameplay in Game Mode Ultra. Sport is also delivered with super-clean image quality; AI Sports Mode manages motion estimation and compensation systems to reduce blur and noise so you never lose sight of the ball in the midst of fast-paced action.

Hisense claims its 116UX RGB-MiniLED will be the biggest TV panel on the market this year. An RGB-MiniLED screen at this scale provides an immersive home entertainment experience that other models will find hard to match.

"Geelong’s cheer squad was a haven for this Cats fan when she needed it the most Underneath Geelong’s GMHBA stadium, the Cats cheer squad are busy. With expectation in the air, a group of more than 30 are beavering away on banners for both the AFLW match against Hawthorn on Thursday night and the AFL grand final against Brisbane on Saturday.

Robyn Cecil sits off to the side, providing instruction and support. “I’ve seen a lot of people come and go,” she says, explaining her involvement with the club. “Coming down here, you have lunch, banner [making], going to the football. But I don’t go to Melbourne any more. I stopped doing that when David passed away, I just felt I couldn’t.”

The Cats are no strangers to playing on the final Saturday in September, but this week the 72-year-old is preparing for something new. The clash with the Lions will be her first grand final since her husband died. “He just went like that,” she says of a day three years ago this November, just weeks after Geelong beat Sydney in the 2022 decider. “He got his photo with the cup, he was here talking with [chief executive] Steve Hocking and then, not long after that, he just went.”

The couple were heavily involved in the cheer squad, as volunteers and in the Cats social club. “I’m very lucky that the footy club, especially Steve … sorry.” Cecil pauses, as her eyes well up. “Steve was the first one to ring me from the footy club, and every time I come down here he makes sure I’m OK.”

She is a regular at the monthly meetings of senior fans known as “coffee club”, a group dating back half a century. “We’d get about 60 people coming, then Covid changed things,” she says. “We are getting back to those numbers again, just [through] word of mouth. You’re looking at an age group of probably 70, 80, 90 … they just like Geelong, love the club, have been members and need something, a get-together.”

In February, at the first meeting of the year, in the room adjacent to the hall she sits in now, Cecil had a fall. “When I did my hip back in February, I had a really good group of friends that were there for me, so that’s what sport does for me,” she says. “They’re good people, I get that phone call: ‘Are you OK?’”

Cecil is on first name terms with most staff at the cafe, in the shop and within the club’s supporter group. Around the cheer squad, she likes to make sure those members with special needs are included. Interviewing her is difficult, so numerous are the greetings and well wishes.

“When David retired from the police force, he needed something to do, so he became a volunteer as well down here,” she says. “He was a member of the social club, and made friends. It just became part of my life – our lives – as well, and then more since David passed away.”

Growing up in western Victoria before moving to Belmont in greater Geelong, she watched her first game with her father at 14. Her favourite player is John Yeates, captain in the 1960s. However, Cecil is reluctant to pick just one. She is especially fond of Bailey Smith. “I like him, he’s different and what you see is what you get,” she says, praising him for being open about his mental health challenges. “It’s genuine, that’s a credit to him.”

After the frenzy of banner production, Cecil will sit down by herself on Saturday at home to watch the grand final. “I might message a friend in Werribee, we were doing that the other night,” she says. “She’d be in her 80s, we used to catch the bus [to Melbourne], we used to stop at Werribee, pick her up on the way through. We just became friends. So that’s what happens, you just become friends.”

"The podcast – and tattoos – connecting Brisbane Lions fans across Australia and beyond Diehard Brisbane fan Dom Fay booked his flights to Melbourne and accommodation near the MCG “a few months ago”. Such is the confidence of a Lions supporter these days, as the team prepares to contest a third straight grand final.

With a ticket to watch Saturday’s premiership decider secured, ordinary fans might spend the rest of the week counting down the days until the big game and checking for updates on Lachie Neale’s calf.

For Fay, as one half of the Roar Deal, the days after Brisbane’s preliminary final win over Collingwood were spent scrambling to organise a live show, a grand final brunch and a March to the ‘G. Fortunately, he has done it all twice before, along with podcast co-host, Michael Whiting. But it wasn’t always this way.

“The year I became a proper, fully signed-up member, obsessive Brisbane Lions fan was 2010,” Fay says. “We won our first four and then barely won again. It began nine years of absolute despair, so I didn’t time it particularly well in terms of jumping on the bandwagon.”

Growing up in a family that followed rugby league, Fay missed Brisbane’s glorious start to the millennium – a three-peat of premierships and average crowds of more than 33,000 at the Gabba. By the time Fay and his father, Richard, committed to going “all in together” on the Lions, the club’s dynasty was long gone and home crowds were on the way to bottoming out at below half of their peak.

“The years were so bleak for a while there that my dad and I, who are complete needle-phobes and the least likely tattoo people on the planet, made a joking deal in 2016 that if we ever saw a Lions flag together, we would get premiership tattoos,” Fay says.

Brisbane were not just off-Broadway. They were out of sight, and out of mind. Playing away from the intense glare of the football media in the heartland states proved a blessing in disguise as the club reached the finals only once in 14 seasons from 2005. But that left little to satisfy the heartiest supporters like Fay, who had high hopes of breaking into sports media, a friend-of-a-friend connection with AFL reporter Whiting, and an idea for reaching fans like himself.

“When you’re a diehard footy fan, it’s not just the game on the weekend, you’re living and breathing it all through the week,” Fay says. “You want to feel as close and connected as you can. Even in the darkest days, there was a core of Lions fans who would have loved a way to go deeper in their support of the club, but there was just nothing for them. We thought it would be cool to speak into that void.”

The podcast was launched from the inner sanctum of the club in 2013 with regular access to players, but challenges around what could – and couldn’t – be said. Fay and Whiting were pushed out of the Lions’ den – for a second time – in 2022 and prepared to end it all there. But enough fans – of the podcast, as much as the club – reached out to convince them to keep the Roar Deal going and set it up independently.

The Roar Deal is now the centrepiece of a community that stretches far beyond the Lions’ home base and roots in Fitzroy, as Fay and Whiting spend several hours each week on “talking all things Brisbane Lions”. As well as a weekly podcast, the Roar Deal offers livestreams, Q&A sessions, watch parties and merch. There are paid-up members and long-time listeners from all parts of the globe.

“We get messages each week from people across the country and across the world who feel like the podcast is their way to stay connected to the club,” Fay says. “I went travelling a bit at the end of last year, and a few Roar Deal listeners reached out to ask me to join them for dinner. So I had dinner with a Roar Deal listener who was living in Paris, another in Barcelona, and another who lived in London.”

Fay and his father now have their premiership tattoos, after the Lions broke a 21-year drought in the grand final last year. They were joined by almost a dozen Roar Deal listeners in getting inked with the hook of the “first tattoo club” helping to lure in fans who were nervous about making the commitment but, Fay says, “had been through those rough years for the Lions together”.

The celebrations peaked a couple of months after the grand final when the Roar Deal duo and Lions coach Chris Fagan sat down in front of 700 fans to review the 2024 premiership. Fay calls the show the “best night of my life”.

“When we were bad, the podcast sometimes made it harder to be a Lions fan, because I couldn’t just park it and not think about football; I still had to talk about the game,” he says. “But when we got good, the podcast has made it so much better to be a fan. And it has provided opportunities I could never have dreamed of.”

Fay and Whiting will be back on stage on Thursday – this time alongside Brisbane great Simon Black at the Royal Derby Hotel in Fitzroy – to talk about the 2025 grand final and the Lions’ hopes of going back-to-back. The show sold out in six minutes but another Roar Deal pre-game event on Saturday is free as Lions fans are invited to meet at Federation Square and walk to the MCG.

The live show and march have quickly become a well-trodden path for Lions fans as their side sets off for a third consecutive grand final.

"Superstitions make way for AFL grand final traditions as Lions fans get used to success Sandra Dunne woke the kids early on Tuesday morning in Narangba to board a train heading south through Brisbane. She didn’t tell Kasey, 11, Kara, 10, or Kiva, 6, their destination, only that they should prepare for a two-hour trip. Then she put on her Lions cap and premiership polo.

When Dunne first left Portlaoise in Ireland for Melbourne chasing the Australian dream of sun and sport, she followed Geelong. Champion Irishman Zach Tuohy, from her county town, was playing for the Cats then.

But after the weather drew them further north, she and the kids went all in on Brisbane, and will cheer on the Lions to defend their premiership crown against the Cats in the 2025 AFL grand final this Saturday.

As their train pulls up at the city, the office workers pour out and Lions tragics straggle in, the kids begin to tweak.

Who are their favourite players? Charlie Cameron, Kasey says without missing a beat. Cam Rayner, Lachie Neale, Harris Andrews, Kai Lohmann.

What would he say if he met them?

Kasey looks at his mum as the train pulls up to its destination at Springfield, looks at the gleaming new headquarters of the Brisbane Lions football club – and is lost for words.

Another in the crowd of several thousand gathered at Springfield for the Lions’ last open training session before the grand final not only has plenty of words for her beloved team, but baked goods.

Karen Gardyne does not like to pick favourite players. Her last was Ash McGrath, who debuted in 2001 and retired more than a decade ago – the last of the Lions to play in one of the triple-premiership winning teams to do so.

But then, a few years ago, she heard current co-captain Harris Andrews on a podcast talking about “a lady in Melbourne who would bring down slices” for the Lions.

“I thought: ‘Oh my gosh, my hubby works at a bakery, I can get him slices!’” Gardyne says.

So she did, found out that Andrews was “just a beautiful human” and had a new favourite player. Later, Gardyne admits she was being modest. Her husband owns a bakery. And Andrews, apparently, though team leader, does not like to share his slices. So Gardyne took that role upon herself.

“Zorko likes his doughnuts,” she says. “Ainsworth likes his chocolate brownies …”

Gardyne is standing at the entry to the change room with a maroon corflute emblazoned with the Lions logo and the words: Believe. Believe. Believe.

It fell from the walls of the MCG at last year’s grand final, she says, after Brisbane trounced Sydney. Gardyne paid the $100 excess baggage fee to fly it home.

She brought it from Logan to Springfield on Tuesday to get it signed by the players so it can take pride of place among the McGrath posters and other “Lions junk” that clutter her walls.

Gardyne is coy on exactly where the corflute came from. She doesn’t want “everyone doing the same thing this year”. But she is more than happy to divulge her pre-grand final plan. With this, her third consecutive trip to Melbourne for “the big dance”, it has become something of a tradition.

Fly down Wednesday. Get her hair done in maroon and blue. Go to the Sunrise Grand Final Brekky Party on Friday, then the Grand Final Parade, followed by the Lions captain’s run, and dinner with the cheer squad at St Kilda.

Those diehards not lucky enough to score tickets to the MCG are preparing to repeat traditions of their own.

The Young siblings Indigo, 11, Zoe, 9 and Harry, 7, will deck out their Kenmore home with Lions coloured balloons and posters, just as they did last year. And, once again, they’ll put a mane on their cat Tilly for the game.

It’s not just Brisbanites who are forming habits on the last Saturday of September.

Jenine, who works in aged care in Beaudesert, is rostered on for grand final day for the second year running. As she did last year, Jenine will switch every residents’ TV on to the AFL.

Unless she can somehow “manifest a ticket”, Carly Balding and her boys Conner, 10, and Parker, 8, will go through their “superstitions”. Wake up early. Have a nice breakfast. Get the place ready.

They will then fetch grandad, John “Jack” Newton – who played a dozen games for Fitzroy Lions in the 1970s and kicked a few big bags of goals before a car crash cruelled his career – from the granny flat. Switch on coverage from the first minute.

“And dress up as Snoop Dogg,” Parker says of the US rapper, who will headline the pre match entertainment. “Put on the hat and sunnies and sing Drop It Like It’s Hot”.

In this part of the world getting used to a new era of September success, there is room for traditions new and old.

Ipswich school teacher Lachlan says he had to make adjustments to his match attire after the Cats trounced his Lions in week one of the finals.

“I wore my 2024 premiership polo for that game and that didn’t go so well,” he says. “Maybe it was a bit arrogant.”

For the next two weeks, he switched back to his normal maroon Lions polo.

“And that seemed to do the trick,” he adds, modestly. “I’m just doing my little bit, I guess”.",Superstitions make way for AFL grand final traditions as Lions fans get used to success,sports,Joe Hinchliffe,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/24/afl-grand-final-brisbane-lions-fans-superstitions-make-way-for-traditions,2025-09-24 00:00:00,"As the Brisbane Lions prepare for the 2025 AFL grand final, fans are embracing new traditions and superstitions, with families traveling to support their team.

"Ageing revolutionary Guardiola is waging war on his own tactical orthodoxies Forgive me father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession.

Thirty-three per cent possession against Arsenal. Five shots. Gianluigi Donnarumma getting more touches than Phil Foden. And at this point, we have to acknowledge that Pep Guardiola is one of the principal reasons this kind of possession pornography exists in the first place: a serendipitous consequence of reinventing the game at exactly the moment we could start measuring the ways in which he was reinventing it, and exactly the moment we could beam it around the world in meme-sized fragments.

The Guardiola supremacy of the late 2000s and 2010s was, among much else, a supremacy of numbers. Xavi completing all 185 of his pass whims against Real Betis. Robert Lewandowski creating 62 goal events in a single season. Manchester City beating Forest County with 102% ball tilt.

The numbers themselves were always largely irrelevant. What mattered was the way in which they were deployed: as a plot device, a form of punctuation, a number in service to the wider narrative. Guardiola teams would beat you once on the pitch and then again in the aftermath, a congregation of clerics and hype men explaining how Pep-ball was not simply more effective but somehow more beautiful, more virtuous, more moral.

And so perhaps there is a certain irony in the fact that Guardiola’s fate is now to be damned by the same tools. Never mind that City were dominant against Napoli last Thursday, or that they will probably suffocate Burnley to death in time-honoured fashion on Saturday.

Something has definitely shifted here, and it shifted long before City ended the Arsenal game in a rugged 5-4-1. Fast breaks are up; possession is down; the average passing sequence is shorter than in any of Guardiola’s 10 Premier League seasons. Of course, the apparatus still exists for City to play controlled possession football if they choose. But these days it increasingly resembles a plan B rather than a plan A, an old ritual being sacrificed on the altar of a new faith.

View image in fullscreen Pep Guardiola has said he wants to adapt his City side to a less possession-based approach. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA

What is the new faith? The new faith is Donnarumma punting for territory, quick long balls for a stampeding Erling Haaland, transitions and lightning breaks, the midfield combat zone often bypassed entirely. The new faith is Abdukodir Khusanov recast as a crunching right‑back, a man who appears to have taken Rico Lewis’s job by eating him. From Dani Alves to Joshua Kimmich to Kyle Walker to Khusanov: this feels like a pretty neat encapsulation of the personal journey Guardiola has taken over the past 15 years.

The demeanour, too, has changed. The Pep of cigars and evangelism and good times has gone, replaced by a more scowling and sardonic touchline presence. For the first time he seems to be dressing his age. The scratches and blotches on his face are a kind of stigmata, the eyes etched with suffering and longing, the blinks and twitches of a man in the tortured process of recanting all he once preached.

In a way, this is the most interesting part of City’s transition over recent months. The disintegration of last autumn forced Guardiola to search deep within himself for answers, and for once he seems to have concluded the answers are elsewhere. “Today, modern football is the way Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton and Liverpool play,” he said in January. After the Arsenal game, he said: “I have to prove myself again with a different strategy.”

Many have concluded on this evidence that Guardiola is moving into his Arsène Wenger phase, or perhaps his José Mourinho phase: the ageing revolutionary stubbornly outstaying his welcome, his outdated ideas curdling as the world keeps spinning. But it’s a comparison that doesn’t really stand up. Ageing managers generally double down on their principles, become more extreme and grotesque versions of their original selves.

And this is how most of us age, right? Wenger’s Arsenal never stopped trying to sign flighty No 10s and passing the ball into the net. Mourinho has cleaved so strongly to his anti-dogma that it’s become a form of dogma in its own right. Why die by your ideas when you can die by a painful low block and Fred in midfield? Even Carlo Ancelotti’s later Real Madrid teams felt like a kind of parody: the ultimate hands-off coach gradually relinquishing control until he managed to disappear entirely.

What Guardiola seems to be doing, by contrast, is actually much more daring and apostate. This is not a coach taking refuge in his principles so much as one departing from them entirely. And we are in largely uncharted territory here, for more reasons than one.

No coach has ever reshaped the game like Guardiola; few coaches ever accumulate sufficient time, personal capital and self-awareness to be able to tear down the cathedral they built. Jürgen Klopp was in the process of doing so at Liverpool but burned himself out before he could complete the job. Louis van Gaal’s later career – winning the Eredivisie playing 4-4-2 with AZ, demolishing the Spanish positional game at the 2014 World Cup – is perhaps the closest modern parallel.

For perhaps a decade football has been wondering if Pep-ball would ever be killed off; it would be the richest of ironies if the coach who did so was the one who created it. Perhaps time and tide will come for Guardiola before then. Unlike his previous tactical evolutions, this is not a change being made from a position of strength. He looks tired and weathered these days, his players less responsive to his ideas, and there is a chance this counter-revolution descends into chaos.

Either way, we may just be about to enter the most fascinating chapter of the Guardiola dynasty: the painful and spellbinding sight of a man clinging to the edge, and finally deciding to let go.",Ageing revolutionary Guardiola is waging war on his own tactical orthodoxies,sports,Jonathan Liew,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/25/ageing-revolutionary-guardiola-is-waging-war-on-his-own-tactical-orthodoxies,2025-09-25 00:00:00,"Pep Guardiola is evolving his tactical approach at Manchester City, moving away from his traditional possession-based style to embrace quicker transitions and a more direct game. This shift comes as Guardiola acknowledges the need to adapt in modern football, with his teams now focusing on fast breaks rather than sustained possession.

"Fifa not planning 64-team men’s World Cup despite Infantino’s Trump Tower summit Fifa is not planning to expand the men’s World Cup to 64 teams for the centenary edition of the tournament in 2030, despite its president, Gianni Infantino, meeting a delegation of South America leaders to discuss the idea in New York.

Infantino met the Uruguay and Paraguay heads of state, the president of South American confederation, Conmebol, as well the presidents of the Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay federations at Fifa’s offices in Trump Tower on Tuesday for the first formal discussions about a proposal that was raised informally by the Uruguayan Football Association at a Fifa Council meeting last March.

Fifa’s official position is that it will discuss World Cup expansion with all its stakeholders and that it is duty-bound to consider proposals raised at council. But behind the scenes there is scepticism about whether expanding the tournament to 64 teams is a viable proposition. Next year’s World Cup will be the first to contain 48 teams, while the governing body has broken with convention for 2030 by staging the tournament in six countries on three continents. Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina will host the first three matches in tribute to the competition’s South American origins in 1930, before the bulk of the tournament moves to Morocco, Spain and Portugal.

Any decision to expand the World Cup would be taken by Fifa Council, which meets in Zurich next month, but that is not on the agenda.

“Gianni would not get that vote through Council even if he wanted to,” a Fifa source said. “The overwhelming feeling around the table – and not just in Europe – is that 64 teams would damage the World Cup. There’d be too many uncompetitive matches and it would risk damaging the business model.”

Conmebol would be the major beneficiaries of another expansion and sources with knowledge of Tuesday’s meeting disclosed that Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina claimed to have the capability to host all of the group stage.

Expansion to 64 teams would mean more than 30% of Fifa’s 211 member associations would take part, as well as putting all 10 Conmebol in the frame to qualify, up from six direct qualifiers next year, plus the possibility of an extra place via an inter-confederation playoff.

The 64-team idea was first presented at Fifa Council last April, but prompted an immediate backlash. The Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, described it as a “bad idea” that would reduce the quality of the tournament and undermine the qualifying competition. The Concacaf president, Victor Montagliani, said: “They [Fifa] can study all they want, but it just doesn’t feel right.” Significantly, both men are Fifa vice-presidents.

Fifa is also facing calls from leading European clubs to expand the Club World Cup from 32 teams in 2029 due to the huge prize and appearance money on offer. Chelsea collected £85m for winning it in July. Staging the competition every two years is also being considered.

A 64-team World Cup would feature 128 matches, double the number played at the most recent tournament in Qatar three years ago and 24 more than next year. The World Cup has grown significantly in recent decades, increasing from 16 to 24 teams in 1982, growing again to 32 in 1998 before becoming a 48-team competition next summer.

Any decision to expand the World Cup would be taken by Fifa’s Council, which meets in Zurich next month, although the issue is not thought to be on the agenda.

Fifa declined to comment.",Fifa not planning 64-team men’s World Cup despite Infantino’s Trump Tower summit,sports,Matt Hughes,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/24/fifa-mens-world-cup-gianni-infantino-not-planning-64-team-expansion-trump-tower-summit,2025-09-24 00:00:00,"FIFA is not planning to expand the men's World Cup to 64 teams for the 2030 tournament, despite discussions led by president Gianni Infantino with South American leaders.

"Bethpage Black: hole-by-hole course guide for the 2025 Ryder Cup 1st: 397 yards, par 4

How much of this hole players will actually see or remember is open to question. Ryder Cup nerves tend to trigger blurry sensations on the 1st tee. That area has been shortened slightly through necessity; namely the installation of a huge grandstand. There is a dog leg to the right from an elevated tee. Any drive leaking right will have an approach blocked out by trees. Those who cut the corner with drivers will have only a flick for their approach, towards a green that is well protected by bunkers. The putting surface is Bethpage Black’s smallest, with a steep slope punishing any shot left short.

2nd: 389 yards, par 4

Another hole that starts from a raised position and another that turns, albeit this time to the left. This is also, like the 1st, a Bethpage rarity in terms of being a short par-four. The key here is hitting the fairway, meaning players are unlikely to hit drivers from the tee. There is a large bunker to the right of the green and a smaller one short and left. The raised green, which is 74ft from front to back, falls off sharply on the left side.

3rd: 210 yards, par 3

The first short hole and a tough one. This is typically rated among the most difficult par-threes in golf. Bunkers – and deep ones – protect a green that is visually tricky because of how narrow it looks from the tee. The perception at the opening shot is that the green sits side on. Any tee shot hit long will be punished by a steep slope behind the putting surface. Threes represent a good score here, regardless of the Ryder Cup format.

4th: 517 yards, par 5

One of the more picturesque holes is relatively short for a par-five and can be reached in two if players are accurate from the tee. The ideal drive is carried over bunkers that guard the left of the hole and into a fairway that tilts to the left before a second set of sand traps on the opposite side. Bunkers are prominent around a raised green, which players may not be able to see when hitting their second. The incline is around 40ft. Unlike the 3rd, players will be looking to better par at this hole, which typically rates as the easiest on the course.

View image in fullscreen The green on the 4th hole at Bethpage Black has a trio of bunkers in play for any loose iron shots. Photograph: David Davies/PA

5th: 478 yards, par 4

Tee shots that miss the fairway to the left cause significant problems. The right is protected by sand, albeit the longer hitters will be able to fly that trouble and would have a decent line in from that area. The green is quite tight – and another that is elevated – with a trio of bunkers on hand to collect any loose iron shots. Players claim this putting surface is more undulating and complex than most at this venue. It is a hole that defines Bethpage Black; a long, arduous par-four.

6th: 408 yards, par 4

A real element of risk and reward. Bunkers on either side of the fairway may lead players to force a driver beyond the sand and to the bottom of a sharp hill. From there, it is a short approach to a pretty flat green. Those deciding to lay back with the tee shot could face close to 200 yards with their second, into a green that has sand all around it. Decision-making and level of accuracy from the tee determine what will play out here.

7th: 524 yards, par 4

This plays as a par five for mere mortals. For the Ryder Cup, it is a seriously strong par four and one of the longest in the world. A drive is placed ideally short of the bunker that sits to the left of the fairway just as the hole turns right. From there, it can still be an approach shot of 200 yards towards a putting surface that has bunkers short left and right. The green is at least long, at close to 90ft, which gives those long iron second shots more chance of clinging on.

8th: 210 yards, par 3

This plays much shorter than the yardage suggests, due to the elevated tee. A mis-hit or short tee shot will bring huge trouble, with a pond at the front of the green. A front pin position teases players into dicing with that hazard. Multiple flag locations are possible on a putting surface that stretches close to 140ft in length.

View image in fullscreen The 8th hole brings huge trouble, with a pond at the front of the green to punish any mis-hit or short tee shots. Photograph: Gary Kellner/PGA of America/Getty Images

9th: 460 yards, par 4

The front nine ends with another par-four with a dog leg, this time to the left. Players are prevented from trying to hug the left side of what is a sloping fairway too tightly by a large bunker. The fairway, however, is wide and generally among the easiest to hit. This is one of umpteen pretty straightforward greens. Key in the minds of players is avoiding the penal bunkers that will grab anything missing short left or right of that putting surface.

10th: 502 yards, par 4

Bunkers stretch for much of both sides of this fairway. Where there is no sand, there is fescue rough, albeit not as thick and problematic as has been witnessed for individual events here. Hitting the fairway therefore becomes the key to happiness on this hole. It is one that caused great controversy at the 2002 US Open after a wind switch left players with 260 yards into a strong breeze just to reach the short grass. The green falls away sharply to catch any approach flying long and left.

11th: 435 yards, par 4

Players have to trust their swing and point of aim from a tee where they will not see the part of the fairway to go for. The best line is to the right, but anything pushed too far that way – or tugged left – will find sand. The green is widely reckoned to be the toughest on the course; it includes a false front that will embarrass anyone who overhits a putt or chip from the back of the putting surface. The 10th, 11th and 12th are three arduous par-fours in succession and offer a key stretch.

View image in fullscreen The green at the 11th hole is widely reckoned to be the toughest on the course, and includes a false front. Photograph: Gary Kellner/PGA of America/Getty Images

12th: 496 yards, par 4

A hole that provides a daunting tee shot. Bunkers guarding the left side must be carried to the tune of 270 yards to set up a straightforward approach to this hole, which turns sharply left. Any drive hit too firmly over that sand will run out of fairway. From that left bunker, it will take an excellent shot to reach and hold what is an undulating green. At the 2019 US PGA Championship, this was the second-highest scoring hole to par at Bethpage.

13th: 608 yards, par 5

After such a testing stretch, this is a relatively simple hole that offers light relief. Rory McIlroy and co will be disappointed if the green is not found in two. Key from the tee is avoiding bunkers to the left and trees on the opposite side. With second shots, sand is also the element to avoid, this time 30 yards short of the green and immediately to the front right, the latter being among the deepest on the course. The green slopes from back to front.

14th: 161 yards, par 3

The tee shot is pretty straightforward, over some foliage and a bunker that will pull in anything played short and right. Do not be deceived by this as the shortest hole on the course. The tricky part arrives on a green that slopes not only from back to front but also left to right. At points, the putting surface is 115ft deep and 120ft wide. Three-putt territory and plenty of it.

15th: 477 yards, par 4

Back to that familiar feeling of an elevated green, to the tune of 50ft, protected by bunkers so deep you feel you could get lost in them. The green is also two-tiered. Consensus is that reaching or staying on that putting surface is wellnigh impossible if the fairway is not found from the tee. The hole bends slightly to the left. Unusually for Bethpage Black, there are no bunkers in play for the opening shot. It routinely plays as the hardest hole.

16th: 539 yards, par 4

By this point, matches are being decided. There is a 50ft drop from the tee on to a fairway that sits slightly from right to left. Players will be able to see the green when standing over that drive. Like the 15th, sand is not an issue from the tee. At the green, though, sand is a very real danger with bunkers left and, particularly, right delivering high penalties. Not too tricky a test, but two straight shots are needed under increasing pressure.

17th: 179 yards, par 3

A hole that looks wonderful from the tee. Like the 1st, the full length for individual events cannot be replicated here because of a the erection of a grandstand. The green is more than 40 yards wide, but nowhere near as deep, leaving players with the perception they have little margin for error. Five bunkers are waiting to catch iron shots that go awry, with the only potential “good miss” long and left. The green sits slightly uphill from the tee. Its right side is significantly below the left.

18th: 411 yards, par 4

How many matches will make it to this point? Those that do will encounter opportunity. On a course that offers little respite, the 18th is a pretty soft challenge. It is also a hole that has seen umpteen variations over the years. The tee shot is played downhill, with players who choose to use their driver having very little left with their second shots. Bunkers will catch a short tee shot to the right or one pulled and longer to the left. The hardest part of this hole is a deceptively sloping green. Hitting approaches to the front section, therefore leaving uphill putts, will be the popular option.",Bethpage Black: hole-by-hole course guide for the 2025 Ryder Cup,sports,Ewan Murray,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/25/bethpage-black-hole-by-hole-course-guide-2025-ryder-cup,2025-09-25 00:00:00,"The 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black will feature a challenging course with a variety of holes that test players' skills and nerves.

"Morikawa urges ‘absolute chaos’ from US fans but Rose backs Europe to focus Justin Rose has vowed Europe’s Ryder Cup stars will not be distracted by the melee around Donald Trump’s visit to Bethpage on Friday, while spectators have been warned to brace themselves for security chaos as a result of the US president’s presence. Europe face broader challenges after the USA team member Collin Morikawa called for home fans to cause “absolute chaos” for the visitors. Morikawa believes the early part of Ryder Cup week has proved “tame”.

Trump’s arrival on the first day of the 45th Ryder Cup will trigger airport-style checks for fans and a ban on several items including folding chairs, umbrellas and vapes. The Bethpage gates will open at the unprecedented time of 5am, more than two hours before play gets under way, in an attempt to alleviate an inevitably tricky situation. Security bubbles and additional screening will be in place around certain areas where Trump could be present.

The focus of Rose and his European teammates is on retaining the trophy won in Rome two years ago. The Englishman, who is taking part in his seventh Ryder Cup, revealed he does not expect the US president to appear on the 1st tee and promised Europe will not lose their focus from the task in hand.

“Obviously he is going to bring certainly a lot of attention and patriotism to the event,” said Rose of Trump. “I don’t think he’s going to necessarily be on the tee box with us or roaming the course. So from that point of view, I think there will just be a lot of noise around it but I’m not sure there will be the continued distraction of it. I could be wrong, just based upon what I’ve heard, how they’re going to handle his movements around the property.

“Listen, it’s great for golf that he’s engaged in the game and obviously he brings a lot of eyeballs with him. Fan-wise, I’m sure Friday afternoon will be certainly very intense and entertaining.”

Rose’s comments suggest Trump will take the advice of the PGA of America and appear for the second rather than opening session on Friday. The Ryder Cup organisers had asked the White House to ensure the president did not come in the morning, in an attempt to alleviate security pressures at this 1400-acre site. About 50,000 spectators are expected at Bethpage on each tournament day.

Security around Trump has been intensified by the recent killing of Charlie Kirk. On Wednesday morning, Ryder Cup organisers announced a string of measures never previously encountered at the biennial event. “Ticketed attendees are strongly urged to arrive as early as possible and should budget extra time as they plan their day,” said a PGA of America statement.

“In addition to security screening at the entrance, spectators will be subjected to TSA [Transportation Security Administration]-style screening points around the clubhouse, adjacent grandstand and surrounding areas. If spectators leave these secure areas, they will need to be screened again prior to reentering that area.

“Gates will open for ticket holders at 5am. Guests should make every effort to restrict personal items to a minimum.

“Guests should expect temporary delays moving around publicly accessible areas inside and outside of the Bethpage Black golf course. These areas may briefly become restricted or frozen spaces before, during or after the event.”

Members of the public are prohibited from bringing laptops, tablets or range finders into Bethpage on Friday. Items banned in the vicinity of the 1st hole are portable folding chairs, large vapes, torch-style lighters, metal or hard plastic beverage containers and large umbrellas.

Morikawa did his bit to crank up pressure on Europe. “I think it’s kind of tame so far,” said the two-time major winner. “I hope Friday is just absolute chaos. I’m all for it. I think it feeds into who we are as the American team. We want it. We want to use that to our advantage. I think we really have to tap into that.

“I hope they come strong. Watching all these kids, I know they want autographs, but come Friday I hope they go crazy.”

"Trump looms large at Ryder Cup where home rules and spicy support are always on show BAAAH-BA-BAAH! It had just gone nine in the morning when the speakers started blasting out Village People’s YMCA. Scottie Scheffler, the world No 1, had arrived on the putting green and everyone was whooping and hollering at him. Scheffler bumped fists with one of his coaches, wrapped another up in a hug and, BAH-BA-BADA-BADA-BAH!, walked on up and across the bridge to the practice ground where there was a crowd of 500 or so waiting.

They started chanting. “YEW-ESS-AY! YEW-ESS-AY!” Scheffler’s a big man. By the time he made it on to the range he seemed to have swelled twice the size.

There are a few hundred thousand reasons why the home team wins two out of three editions of the Ryder Cup. One of them is the nature of the courses, which, like the English language, are the same, but different either side of the Atlantic. The second is that the captains are allowed to tweak the widths of the fairways, the height of the rough and the speed of the greens to suit their own team.

The rest are all paying upwards of $750 to attend. The Ryder Cup always draws the rowdiest crowds in the game. The tribalism, says the US’s Patrick Cantlay, “has become such an integral part of this event, it’s just to be expected”.

But this year, no one is sure what is coming. Donald Trump is due on Friday afternoon and his visit is looming over the tournament like a balloon at the Thanksgiving Day parade.

The only thing anyone can predict with any certainty is that Long Island is going to be gridlocked. The organisers, who are already trying to funnel tens of thousands of fans in and out of the grounds, have been in endless negotiations over the arrangements. The US Open men’s tennis final was held up for the best part of an hour when Trump decided to come along and watch. Organisers here have asked him to delay his appearance until later in the day because they were so worried about the hold-ups caused by his security. The admission conditions include rules against bringing in backpacks, banners and stools, but it is less clear what the policy is on a nuclear football.

The European team are so worried about what they are going to be up against that they have been using VR headsets to condition themselves to all the heckling they are expecting. The first day of practice felt like trying to play 18 in the middle of a Maga rally.

Trump got a mixed reception at Flushing Meadows, but US golf is further to the right than my slice and Bethpage is in Trump country. He won Nassau County by 4.2 percentage points in the 2024 election, a 14-point swing from 2020. In 2016, he chose the town for his homecoming rally before the New York primary. He told the crowd how he used to get up at 2am so he could get a tee-time here.

Which, like everything else Trump claims in the game, may or may not be true. He also says he has a 2.8 handicap and has won 36 club championships, including six in a single year, achievements that would mean a lot more if he ever registered his scores or played in tournaments at clubs he didn’t own against competitors he couldn’t boot out.

It is one of the sport’s open secrets that he is an inveterate cheat. Rick Reilly wrote a book about it. The only honest thing about Trump’s golf is how much he loves it. Pretty much every player here can tell you a story about how he has called them to talk through their latest victory in excruciating detail.

He will be the first sitting president to attend the competition. George HW Bush went to Valhalla in 2008 and his son turned up at Brookline in 1999, when he was running for the presidency. The US captain, Ben Crenshaw, invited him in to address the team on the Saturday night when they were four-points down. Bush decided to read them William B Travis’s letter from the Alamo: “The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken – I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still waves proudly from the walls.”

By the time Bush was done the team were so worked up that the next day they became the first team to come back from more than two points down before the singles to win the Cup. Along the way, one of the European player’s wives was spat at, the father of another left the course early because of the amount of abuse being thrown at his son and the US team ended up barnstorming the 17th green before José María Olazábal had the chance to make his last putt.

On the BBC, Alistair Cooke said the day would “go down in infamy”. It was, everyone agreed afterwards, one of the most ignominious days in the history of the competition. It also, as Trump might point out, set a TV ratings record that stood for 13 years.

Who knows what Bethpage is going to be like on Friday. The US captain, Keegan Bradley, suggested he was expecting Trump to set himself up by the first tee. “I’m just thrilled he’s going to be here. I really look forward to what that first tee is going to be like with the president on the tee. It’s going to be something everyone will remember for ever.” He is probably right about that, one way or the other.

Scheffler, who you can only assume is too busy playing to listen to many of his president’s speeches, described Trump as “one of those guys when you’re around him, he does such a good job of feeding confidence into everybody around him. That was one of the things I noticed a lot with the little bit of time I spent with him, he treats everybody the same and treats people with the utmost respect.” Maybe Scottie does a fine line in irony, but my guess is he thinks it is the thing he packs in his bag next to the 3-wood.

There is another irony here. Bethpage Black was built by Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Works Progress Administration, one of 250 municipal courses constructed as part of a drive to open up the game “to a new kind of average golfer” during the New Deal. Roosevelt was a golfer too, club champion, secretary and treasurer at Campobello in Maine. He designed a course especially for people recovering from polio at Warm Springs in Georgia; it has roads and reinforced bridges so patients could be driven in between holes. It is a very different idea of the game to the one we are going to see played out in the next few days.",Trump looms large at Ryder Cup where home rules and spicy support are always on show,sports,Andy Bull,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/24/trump-ryder-cup-spicy-support-use-europe-golf,2025-09-24 00:00:00,"The Ryder Cup is set to be overshadowed by Donald Trump's attendance, expected to cause significant security and logistical challenges for organizers.

"Antony swoops late for Betis to deny Nottingham Forest on European return Already for Ange Postecoglou it feels like an interminable wait. Just as it seemed he would record his first victory as Nottingham Forest manager in a competition he won last season, Antony levelled for Real Betis to kill the impending party.

Igor Jesus scored twice as Forest recovered from Cédric Bakambu’s opener and hit the woodwork in pursuit of a first-half hat-trick but the former Manchester United winger, derided in some quarters after struggling in the Premier League, struck a 85th-minute equaliser.

Compared to the capitulation last Wednesday in altogether different surroundings at Swansea, this was nothing – the Championship club scored in the 93rd and 97th minute to earn a comeback Carabao Cup victory – but it was a galling finish all the same.

Forest under Postecoglou have so far been a double-edged proposition but the overriding feeling for the travelling fans at the final whistle – about 5,000 flocked to Seville, 3,385 were stationed up in the gods in the away end – was probably pride. “Europe again, olé, olé,” they sang as the players headed in their direction.

The most appetising takeaway was undoubtedly Igor Jesus’s first goal, a slick team move and an explicit example of Postecoglou’s vision. “I guess that’s the challenge: to make sure the players don’t drop their heads because we’re not getting the victories,” the Australian said. “Some of the football we played was outstanding.”

This was a big moment, Forest’s first competitive game on the European stage since March 1996 and, as Postecoglou highlighted, finally an opportunity for the generations of supporters who have heard the stories of yesteryear but not lived the experiences. The thing Postecoglou now craves is that first win and Forest will hope it comes at the fifth time of asking, when Sunderland visit the City Ground for his first home game. “We are in a results business and ultimately we need to convert our good into victories,” Postecoglou said. “If one goes in off one of the boys’ backsides, I won’t be disappointed with that either because we’re missing a bit of luck.”

View image in fullscreen Igor Jesus scores Forest’s first European goal for 29 years. Photograph: Marcelo del Pozo/Reuters

The Forest fans sang about trips to Gillingham, Huddersfield, Hull and Rotherham; five years ago on Thursday they lost 1-0 at Huddersfield, with Ryan Yates, a late substitute here, the sole survivor from the squad that day. Evangelos Marinakis has spent millions furnishing the squad since, including £200m this summer so that the squad could compete on all fronts, and amid the celebrations after promotion three years ago, the Greek billionaire vowed to return Forest to Europe. “Sometimes you don’t see the future because you always talk about the past,” he said.

Consider this a vision fulfilled, then, Marinakis present as Igor Jesus became Forest’s goalscorer in Europe since Steve Stone’s consolation against Bayern Munich 29 years ago.

Betis began quicker and gained the lead after quarter of an hour, Antony skating past Morato and punching a pass into Bakambu, who blasted high into the top corner of Matz Sels’s goal. But they had the upper hand for just three minutes, Igor Jesus applying a simple finishing touch to a wonderful Forest move.

Quick Guide Europa League roundup: Celtic earn point in Belgrade Show The half-time substitute Kelechi Iheanacho fired Celtic ahead in Belgrade before the Scottish champions had to settle for a point against Red Star in their Europa League opener. Iheanacho finished brilliantly as Celtic made a flying start to the second half but they were pegged back by former West Ham, Stoke and Inter forward Marko Arnautovic, who scrambled the ball home after a corner. Brendan Rodgers’ side could not get back on the front foot and would have been more than satisfied to take a 1-1 draw back from Serbia given the overall balance of play in the Rajko Mitic Stadium. Iheanacho had replaced Daizen Maeda at half-time after the Japan international struggled in the centre-forward role. Celtic had failed to make any chances from open play by half-time but they immediately improved, forcing three saves before Iheanacho took an excellent touch in the box and stroked the ball into the top corner in the 55th minute. On the performance of Maeda, who was denied a summer move because of the club's failure to source an adequate replacement, Rodgers told BT Sport: ""He wasn't at his best, or nowhere near it. However, he's a good guy and sometimes that happens in the game. I could have made a couple of changes at half-time. I wanted to make that one certainly to give us that greater reference at the top of the pitch. I thought Kels coming in was very, very good for us. ""We needed someone centrally to hold the ball up. I felt that we arrived into the final third in the first half and then we were either loose with the ball or didn't hold the ball up. ""It's one of Kels' great strengths. He can take the ball in, he can use his body well and obviously allows you to progress up the pitch. So he gave us a really much better platform in the second half."" Roma began their campaign with a 2-1 victory at Nice, sparked by quickfire goals from defenders Evan N'Dicka and Gianluca Mancini within three minutes early in the second half, after a cautious and uneventful opening period.

Terem Moffi pulled one back for the hosts from the penalty spot in the 77th minute after Niccolo Pisilli brought down Antoine Mendy inside the area, setting up a tense finish, but Nice could not find the equaliser despite late pressure.

Nice captain Dante became the oldest outfield player in the competition's history at 41. Portuguese side Braga celebrated a 1-0 home victory over Feyenoord, sealed by Fran Navarro's decisive strike in the 79th minute. PA Media, Reuters Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

Forest shifted the ball from left to right, Oleksandr Zinchenko, the left-back having floated to the edge of the opposition 18-yard box, and Elliot Anderson playing one-touch passes before Douglas Luiz located Morgan Gibbs-White, playing on the right of a three-pronged attack. Gibbs‑White slid a diagonal ball across goal and Igor Jesus converted from inside the six-yard box. Postecoglou retreated towards the away dugout, applauding as he went, and more joy followed five minutes later. Douglas Luiz whipped an inswinging corner into the box and Igor Jesus headed in.

Forest were in control after acquainting themselves and at half‑time they could reflect on 13 shots to Betis’s one, with Igor Jesus, who also scored twice at Swansea, rattling a post as he came within inches of a 14-minute hat-trick. Forest were rampant and should have extended their lead. Arnaud Kalimuendo, who replaced the cautioned Igor Jesus, fluffed his lines as Forest soared upfield; Zinchenko ignored Dan Ndoye, another substitute, to his left and instead fed Kalimuendo, whose first touch hindered his progress.

The size of the task facing Forest was clear at the outset given Betis, eighth in La Liga, had lost just one of their previous 18 home games in European competition. The Betis substitute Pablo Fornals flashed a shot wide and it proved a warning sign the visitors did not heed. Natan, the centre-back, then made a mess of a golden chance a minute later, but Antony seized his.",Antony swoops late for Betis to deny Nottingham Forest on European return,sports,Ben Fisher,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/24/europa-league-real-betis-nottingham-forest-match-report,2025-09-24 00:00:00,"Nottingham Forest's hopes for a victory in their European return were dashed when Antony scored a late equalizer for Real Betis, resulting in a 2-2 draw.

The match marked a significant moment for Forest, as it was their first competitive game on the European stage since 1996.",1,0,1
"Eberechi Eze opens Arsenal account in Carabao Cup victory at Port Vale For Arsenal the night will be remembered for Eberechi Eze’s first goal for the club, but for Port Vale they will look back at when they ran a Premier League giant to the very end, only to fall short and out of the Carabao Cup.

Once Eze scored early on, it felt as if Arsenal would thrash their League One opponents, but instead it was a tight game as Port Vale gave everything. They did not have the requisite quality and Arsenal scored again, the second coming late from Leandro Trossard. There was doggedness in abundance but Vale’s inability to have a shot on target summed up their shortcomings.

The hosts offered the anticipated blood-and-thunder approach in the opening seconds of the match, spurred on by the biggest Vale Park crowd this century. But before the smoke from the pre-match pyrotechnics settled, Arsenal were in control and ahead. Gabriel Martinelli found Eze in the middle of the box in the eighth minute, aided by a Myles Lewis‑Skelly dummy, and the former Crystal Palace playmaker calmly placed the ball beyond Joe Gauci.

“I’ve been waiting to score for this club for a long time and the first is very special,” Eze said.

Mikel Arteta put out a strong team, the only debutant being the world’s most expensive goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. For all their domination, enjoying more than 80% possession in the match, Arsenal did not test Gauci until Mikel Merino flicked the ball through for Eze but the goalkeeper was off his line quickly to block. Port Vale hassled their way back into the game, lifting the crowd through work-rate as they did their best to pressurise the Gunners. Considering how early Arsenal took the lead, the League One side were boosted by reaching half-time with a single-goal deficit.

Arsenal needed something to silence the majority inside Vale Park but were unable to find their rhythm against a team set up to frustrate. There was greater confidence in the Vale ranks the longer the score stayed at 1-0. They were more eager to send the ball into the Arsenal box and make them think, rather than the conservative approach that was the hallmark of the opening 45 minutes. “In the second half we lost a little bit of grip of the game, especially with the direct play, with all the throws from the sidelines and winning territory and then again,” Arteta said. “We lacked a bit of dominance and control.”

Thank you for your feedback.

If the idea was to get players into a rhythm, Bukayo Saka struggled to cause Vale problems. He was slow in possession and rarely had a chance to run at the defence, often needing to turn back. Saka was booed off in the 63rd minute by the home supporters, who were upset by his reaction to an earlier challenge.

The League One strugglers were having the better of the action, causing Arsenal to panic at the back. Port Vale could have equalised if they were more dynamic after a misplaced Cristhian Mosquera pass across his own box and a rising drive from Devante Cole kept Arrizabalaga interested until the last second when it whistled over the bar.

Instead of celebrating, supporters were silenced, apart from complaints about a potential offside, when a direct ball from William Saliba found Trossard. The substitute took a few touches and fired into the bottom corner from the edge of the box to send Arsenal into the next round and break Vale hearts.

“To see this ground packed,” the Port Vale manager, Darren Moore, said of the positives to be taken. “I told the boys if they can bottle tonight and take it into the league we won’t go far wrong. We played an elite team with a top manager. I am proud of the boys tonight.”",Eberechi Eze opens Arsenal account in Carabao Cup victory at Port Vale,sports,Will Unwin,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/24/carabao-cup-third-round-port-vale-arsenal-match-report,2025-09-24 00:00:00,"Arsenal secured a narrow 2-0 victory over Port Vale in the Carabao Cup, highlighted by Eberechi Eze's first goal for the club.

Mathys Tel took a fresh-air swipe at a Brennan Johnson right-wing cross in the first half … and he’s just done exactly the same thing again in this second period. Another big chance spurned.

"Turbulent end at Red Bull fails to deter Christian Horner’s potential new suitors When Christian Horner announced to the staff at Red Bull he had been dismissed by the company to whom he had dedicated 20 years of his life, he was, understandably, reduced to tears. On Monday that parting was formally sealed with a multimillion-pound settlement and Horner is free to move on. It is all but impossible to imagine he will not attempt to hurl himself back into Formula One, doubtless spurred-on by having a point to make to his former employer.

On Monday Horner and Red Bull’s parent company, Red Bull GmbH, announced they had reached an agreement worth £80m to end his career with the team, after he had been removed from his post as team principal shortly after the British GP in July.

Horner had led Red Bull since its first season in 2005, taking them from humble beginnings to eight drivers’ and six constructors’ titles. His credentials as a team leader, for all that some dislike his style, his attitude and his singular approach to going racing, cannot be questioned. Alongside Mercedes’ Toto Wolff and Jean Todt at Ferrari, he has been the most successful team principal of this millenium.

It is understood the 51-year-old is indeed eager to return to the fray. While no details have been released, it is believed as part of his settlement his period of gardening leave could end after spring next year, after the opening flyaway rounds but before the summer. However, quite where he might be then remains moot.

Having taken his treatment by Red Bull hard, returning as an employee, subject again to the whims of the board, would understandably not be his preferred choice. He is thought to be far more interested in becoming at least a part owner of a team as well as its boss. No easy task. The days of setting up a team from scratch on a shoestring are long gone and approval for new entries are as rare as hen’s teeth and could take years.

Buying into an existing outfit would be the likely path. However, for all that his settlement was eye-wateringly large, it is nowhere near enough to go it alone. McLaren were recently valued at £3.5bn and 2024 estimates on even the underperforming Alpine put it at $1.5bn (£1.1bn).

Buying in at the lower end of the scale would also require investment backing but would offer the chance of being at least a co-owner, similar to Wolff at Mercedes. The most attractive option in this case would be Alpine. He is close friends with Flavio Briatore, the team’s executive adviser and de-facto boss who is running it on behalf of the owner, Renault. Moreover they have long been an outfit underperforming given their facilities, resources, experience and personnel. Exactly the sort of environment Horner transformed to reap such success at Red Bull.

When asked about it before Horner’s settlement with Red Bull, Briatore, wily as ever, evaded the issue by noting: “Christian is not in Formula One in this moment any more. I hope he comes back soon but, for the moment, he’s not in the picture of Alpine.” That moment has now passed and for all that Renault protest they do not want to sell the team, they no longer manufacture their own engines and their ownership now has the sense of a legacy waiting to be dealt with. A Briatore-Horner team-up also has a heady air of drama about it that the pair would doubtless adore.

Haas too could also offer a potential buy-in on a slightly cheaper scale but they do not have quite the sleeping giant promise of Alpine and would present a challenge of immense longevity.

In terms of just taking a team principal role again, Ferrari too have been suggested. John Elkann, the Ferrari chair, admires Horner and before his dismissal he was being linked to a potential move to the Scuderia. However, since then they have renewed Fred Vasseur’s contract as team principal.

Aston Martin have also been in the frame as a destination and certainly a big name like Horner would fit the grand ambition of the owner, Lawrence Stroll, but for one potential major stumbling block. Aston and Stroll have made no secret of their desire to sign the four-time world champion Max Verstappen.

Given the breakdown in relations between the Verstappen camp and Horner at Red Bull, in particular the acrimony from Verstappen’s father, Jos, toward Horner, it is impossible to imagine they would countenance joining a team with him in charge. While Verstappen remains a potential target for Aston Horner is unlikely to be worth taking the risk of alienating their prize for.

Now his deal is done Horner will surely be considering these and other options, albeit with the Alpine path seeming most likely. However, he may yet also play a waiting game. With major regulation changes due next season, including new engines, there may be no little upheaval in the air by mid-2026. Teams that have adapted badly and are off the pace will be looking for fresh blood and Horner would make for an enormously enticing proposition. His time at Red Bull might have ended in turbulence but it is extremely doubtful he has lost his touch.",Turbulent end at Red Bull fails to deter Christian Horner’s potential new suitors,sports,Giles Richards,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/24/turbulent-end-at-red-bull-fails-to-deter-christian-horners-potential-new-suitors,2025-09-24 00:00:00,"Christian Horner's departure from Red Bull after 20 years was marked by an £80 million settlement, allowing him to seek new opportunities in Formula One. Despite the emotional toll of his dismissal, Horner is eager to return, potentially as a part-owner of a team, with Alpine being a likely candidate due to his connections there. However, his past conflicts with drivers like Max Verstappen may complicate his options in the sport.",1,0,1
"‘We are in a new age of women’s rugby’: Abbie Ward on motherhood and World Cup redemption Abbie Ward’s life has been transformed since England’s last World Cup final appearance but, in some ways, little has changed. While motherhood has taught her that, in theory, there are bigger things to worry about than a game of rugby, there is no disguising that victory on Saturday would be the sweetest of redemption stories.

Three years ago in Auckland it all came down to the final lineout of a spectacular final: secure possession to set up a familiar driving maul and the trophy would be heading the way of the Red Roses. Instead New Zealand nicked the ball off Ward’s fingertips and, for a second successive tournament, England and their relentless lock forward had to settle for honourable defeat.

Given Ward had long kept a picture in her purse of her No 4 jersey on its peg from 2017 to fuel her motivation levels and the pain of another major defeat was considerable. “It’s a cruel, cruel sport,” she murmured to a couple of us below the stands at Eden Park as she tried her best to rationalise the unthinkable.

Yet here she is again, now 32, looking to make it third time lucky while juggling her career alongside being a mum to two‑year‑old Hallie. She freely admits it would mean even more to conquer the world with Hallie (along with her husband, Dave, now the head coach of Ampthill) up in the stands. “To have her pitchside, to be able to see her in the crowd when we line up to sing the anthem, it’s so special. She’s the biggest Red Roses fan and it’s amazing to be able to share that with her.”

So, no pressure. Ward, though, is adamant the Red Roses will not wilt under the heavy weight of expectation and the presence of a world-record 82,000 crowd for a standalone women’s fixture this weekend. “Yes, we have never played in front of 82,000 but what we have experienced is huge crowds, pressure games and pressure moments. And we’re at home. We are used to getting off the bus and doing that walk [through the crowd], we are used to the roar and the noise. We love it and thrive off that.”

Tactically speaking the aim is not to reinvent the wheel; as Ward makes clear, the squad have been preparing for this game “for what seems like three years”. And during that time the Bristol forward has been driven by both a motivation to show that mothers can come back stronger after childbirth and to help her team to inspire the next generation of young girls and boys.

“To see the number of young girls on their mum’s or dad’s shoulders, watching our games, facepaint on, waving flags, it’s unbelievable. It’s about more than what we’re doing on the pitch. It’s about inspiring that generation and showing girls that they can do it; that they can be strong, powerful, and put their minds to whatever they want to.”

The women’s game has certainly come a long way since Ward’s distant representative debut. “My first cap was away in Swansea when we lost to Wales and there must have been 40 people in the crowd. If you had told me then that in 2025 I would be playing in a World Cup final at a sold-out Twickenham, I could not even have contemplated that.

To see the number of young girls on their mum or dad’s shoulders, facepaint on, waving flags, it’s unbelievable

“I am so proud to have been part of the women’s rugby journey. It’s more than just a game, it’s all of us. It means an awful lot and to have my daughter as part of that is so special.”

And while Hallie is clearly a rugby connoisseur – apparently she likes to watch videos of Amy Cokayne while having her hair brushed – she remains unaware of how much her arrival has altered her mum’s outlook. Where previously Ward was “quite a serious individual” and “very process driven”, her eyes have been opened to the role of enjoyment in high‑performance sport.

“Coming back after [having Hallie] has made me think: ‘Just enjoy it.’ When I was away with the team in Vancouver, it was the first time where I didn’t have to wake up really early, didn’t have to think about bath time. I thought: ‘I’m just going to enjoy the experience.’ It’s helped me not take it so seriously.”

View image in fullscreen Abbie Ward says her two-year-old daughter, Hallie, is now her inspiration in rugby. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian

And instead of the old picture in her purse, she now has a different driver. “If you want to know about that photo, it’s on my wall with a load of different Polaroids from big and meaningful moments across the years. Although they might not have been the moments we wanted to feel in 2017 and 2022, they have got us to where we are. But Hallie is my motivation now. When we’re working really hard or doing horrible sessions on the pitch I’ll think: ‘Pretend Hallie is at the end.’ It does give me that extra boost. It means an awful lot.”

All of which will keep Ward fighting to the finish on Saturday in pursuit of complete career fulfilment. For now, though, she has no plans to retire, citing Alun Wyn Jones, Sam Whitelock and Courtney Lawes as warrior inspirations and all that matters is the here and now.

“‘Redemption’ or whatever would be the easy thing to say. It’s a different squad, it’s a different opposition, it’s a different World Cup. I feel like we are in a new age of women’s rugby, a new age of sold-out stadiums and millions of people tuning in. Dwelling on any of the other [finals] wouldn’t serve any purpose. It’s all about this Saturday.”",‘We are in a new age of women’s rugby’: Abbie Ward on motherhood and World Cup redemption,sports,Robert Kitson,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/24/womens-rugby-world-cup-england-abbie-ward-motherhood-redemption,2025-09-24 00:00:00,"Abbie Ward reflects on her journey from England's last World Cup final to now, balancing motherhood with her rugby career as she prepares for another final.

She embraces the pressure of playing in front of a record crowd, emphasizing the importance of enjoyment in her performance.",1,0,1
"The case of cricket and a custom-made diplomatic row over missing handshake It is seen on village greens and in Test arenas alike. It is there at the start of the game, just after the coin toss, and it is there at the end when the final run is struck or wicket falls. According to research from the University of Dundee it should last between one-and-a-half and three seconds, just long enough to reassure both participants, but not so long as to feel overbearing.

In the tapestry of the sport it is less consequential than the colour of the captain’s socks or what the home team has laid out for tea. And yet its absence is instantly conspicuous, sometimes enough to spark controversy, fines or even diplomatic fallout.

The most recent reminder came this month. India had just beaten Pakistan in the Asia Cup by seven wickets, but there was no post-match handshake. No nods, no pats on the back. Just players collecting kit and heading for the tunnel. The omission was deafening. Within hours, clips of the “no-handshake” were being dissected frame by frame online. #Handshakegate was trending.

The Pakistan Cricket Board lodged a formal complaint with the Asian Cricket Council and India officials replied that handshakes are a custom, not a law, and soon enough a match referee found himself in the headlines. On Sunday, India again kept their hands firmly in their pockets. For a gesture meant to signal closure, this one had opened an international row.

India’s captain, Suryakumar Yadav, was clear that the snub was a consequence of recent border tensions between the two nuclear powers. In April, 26 civilians were killed in a militant attack in India-administered Kashmir. The Indian government blamed Pakistan and launched a counterstrike in response. Fighter planes were shot down and holy sites were damaged. Against that backdrop, the absence of handshakes was hardly just a matter of etiquette. It became shorthand for a wider political freeze.

Cricket has always carried a freight beyond bat and ball: a handshake at the end of a match is supposed to mean that whatever has transpired stays on the field. When the hands stay unshaken, it signals something else entirely. The MCC’s Spirit of Cricket preamble calls on players to “respect opponents” and play hard, but fair, and the handshake is its simplest, most visible embodiment.

History is dotted with moments when the clasp of palms stood for something more grand. The coming together of Richie Benaud and Frank Worrell after the first tied Test, between Australia and West Indies, in 1960, helped forge a rivalry and signal the sport’s expansion beyond its traditional centres. That West Indies team, led by Worrell, was the first to be captained for an entire series by a Black cricketer, a moment that challenged the old hierarchies of empire and proved that players from the islands could not only compete with, but thrill, the cricketing world.

In 1987, Pakistan’s General Zia-ul-Haq flew to Jaipur for what was dubbed “cricket diplomacy”, exchanging handshakes with India’s prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, at a time when their nations were on the brink of conflict. And in Mohali in 2011, Manmohan Singh and Yusuf Raza Gilani walked on to the outfield before the World Cup semi-final to greet the teams. For a few hours the game became a proxy for detente, the handshake a stand-in for a peace summit.

If those are handshakes as olive branches, cricket has also given us handshakes as icons. Twenty years ago, in an Ashes bursting with enduring images, Andrew Flintoff stooped to shake Brett Lee’s hand after England’s two-run win at Edgbaston. Winner and loser are indistinguishable as two exhausted heroes shared a moment of mutual respect. It’s the spirit of cricket in one frame, captured by the Guardian’s Tom Jenkins.

The history of cricket handshakes has its flashpoints and 2023 produced three that crackled like live wires. In February, Scotland refused post-match handshakes with Nepal’s Sandeep Lamichhane in protest while he faced sexual-coercion charges (a subsequent rape conviction was quashed on appeal in 2024). In May, Virat Kohli and Naveen-ul-Haq’s Indian Premier League handshake flared into a glare-off that drew fines before the pair reconciled during the World Cup in October. And in November, after Angelo Mathews became the first batter to be timed out at a one-day World Cup, Sri Lanka’s players declined to shake hands with Bangladesh, exacerbating an already simmering feud between the sides.

Then there was Old Trafford in July. With India’s Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar – both in the 90s – batting for a draw, Ben Stokes decided enough was enough. The England captain extended a stiff right hand to bring the game to a premature end, but the pair declined, opting to continue their pursuit of deserving centuries. At stumps, a brief clip appeared to show Stokes refusing to shake Jadeja’s hand. Within hours the moment had been edited, captioned and turned into a referendum on the spirit of cricket. Later footage showed the two did shake hands at the presentation, but by then the narrative had run away: the snub, real or imagined, had become the story.

Why does this matter? Social psychologists have shown that a handshake shapes first impressions, signalling trust, confidence and respect. Cricket, for ever a slave to ritual and the impression of decency, has turned this seemingly inconsequential gesture into something important. No wonder a missing handshake feels like a violation of an unspoken contract, not just between individuals or nations, but against the game itself.",The case of cricket and a custom-made diplomatic row over missing handshake,sports,Daniel Gallan,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/24/the-case-of-cricket-and-a-custom-made-diplomatic-row-over-missing-handshake,2025-09-24 00:00:00,"The absence of post-match handshakes between India and Pakistan's cricket teams following a recent Asia Cup match has sparked controversy and diplomatic tensions, highlighting the significance of this gesture in cricket culture. The handshake, traditionally a sign of respect and closure, has become a symbol of broader political issues between the two nations, with players and officials acknowledging its importance beyond the game. Historical instances of handshakes in cricket have often represented moments of reconciliation, making their absence particularly poignant.",1,0,1
"Ousmane Dembélé’s Ballon d’Or is a human victory amid the toxic theatre of football Even after a few hours of sober reflection it was still hard to identify exactly which bit of the reliably nauseating 69th Ballon d’Or ceremony was the single most nauseating bit of the reliably nauseating 69th Ballon d’Or ceremony. One thing is certain. We have a powerful shortlist here. The competition is generational. But this is also the elite, the god tier. And as ever there must be a winner.

Was it the first nauseating thing at the Théâtre du Châtelet; the crowd of otherwise normal Parisians transformed into fame‑zombies, thronged against the barriers four hours before the ceremony, whooping and gawping as bored-looking blokes moved broadcast boxes around, baying at passing female TV presenters, spectating the buildup to an awards do in a state of celebrity delirium?

Or was the most nauseating thing the pre-ceremony outrage in the French media, who railed at this soiree de folie because Paris Saint‑Germain had to play an actual football match the same evening, postponed from Sunday because of storms, rather than being present at a fancy party, a state of fomo that seems a little at odds with the new humble non-ego PSG.

Was it just the wider phenomenon, the sense of some peak moment of personality cult, the confusion of talent with virtue, the superhero-ising of people who just happen to be very good at sport? Or is it the way awards culture coincides perfectly with the model that football’s owners want to impose, the move towards names, brands, individualism, that are so much easier to buy and sell than the old anchor points of place, culture and badge-loyalty?

See for example Fifa’s Club World Cup. See also the newest award on Monday night, the team action prize. The title suggests some vision of collectivism and humility; in reality this was basically the words “Yamal”, “Messi”, “Mbappé”, “Brazil” and “PSG” and an online shortlist that reads like the most cynically engineered act of SEO catnip. Reading it you wondered why “Britney Spears”, “What Time Is It Now” and “Dogging sites in Kent where are” weren’t also up for gongs.

Maybe it was the funny stuff at the ceremony that stood out. Early on a multilingual sexy singer appeared and sang a multilingual sexy song which seemed at one point to be actually called Multilingual Sexy. To be fair, this was also just very French. And Charlotte Cardin, who is Canadian, was great, creating energy out of nothing on an empty stage.

So that was one good bit. As was the sight of that iconic duo DJ Snake and Javier Pastore wandering on stage so that Javier could give a really earnest meandering speech while Snake stood next to him looking cool. Snake eventually did some PSG rabble-rousing before having to announce, to his own obvious battlement, that actually Arsenal Women had won team of the year, because in fact this isn’t just a PSG-hype event. The crowd booed the Arsenal players. Snake snuck back to his snug. Mainly you felt gutted for Snake. Don’t do Snake like that.

Or maybe it was all of these things. Maybe everything was equally nauseating and everyone gets to be a winner. Except, of course, this is never the full story. This is what happens with elite modern football. Just when you think you’re done with the whole thing, just when it seems to have entered the arena of the unreal, that’s then football will pull you back in, like the serial adulterer narco don husband who buys you supermarket flowers and says Noreen I’m still the man you fell in love with, and dammit he’s right. Stop it football. Stop re-seducing me.

There were a few things that did this. Sarina Wiegman: yes, a good football person. Gianluigi Buffon beaming as Hannah Hampton got her award, like a goalkeeping Gandalf. Mainly, though, the thing that did this was Ousmane Dembélé winning the men’s Ballon d’Or, the most hyped award of the night.

5:48 'I wasn't planning on crying': Ousmane Dembélé and Aitana ­Bonmatí win Ballon d’Or awards – video

This is the same Dembélé who plays for a state project. And the same Dembélé whose Ballon d’Or captures the beauty of that enduring paradox, the way football continues to house irresistibly relatable human qualities no matter how you stretch it thin or inject it with toxins. Here we have not just a wonderful footballer but an uplifting human story, embodied in a nice man who just happens also to have had a brilliant year in a brilliant team. And yes, football, we’re back on. For now.

There is a trap here, too. Don’t go too far. Don’t go Full L’Équipe. Don’t make out Dembélé is both Football Jesus and a one‑man tactical “school” because he did a lot of high-speed pressing. Don’t talk too much about the “fulfilment of a tortuous destiny” which shows that “all stories are possible”.

It’s not Ousmane versus the machine, or a case of Agent Dembélé, as online Real Madrid avatars have been quick to crow, the ruinously expensive underperformer who has now seen off the La Masia golden child. The world must always be binary, and Lamine Yamal has been unavoidably part of Dembélé’s triumph. There is something genuinely galling about the post‑ceremony online outrage, the idea this preternaturally talented 18‑year‑old, already enriched beyond reason, fawned over by adults, wheeled around in his bath chair like a golden princeling, is in some way being victimised by not having another gong forced into his hands.

The fact is Lamine Yamal is also an underdog story, a kid from humble origins with nothing but talent to carry him. He is already, on pure brain-melting talent, the best player in the world. He will go on to win loads of these things. But he would also have been the youngest winner by three years. When the reigning holder of that mark won it, the original Ronaldo, he had just scored 47 goals in a season for Barcelona and 15 in the year for Brazil. And yes the counter to this is that no other player makes you feel like Lamine Yamal, that he is an extraordinary avatar of individualism in a systems-dominated game.

But this also doesn’t stop Dembélé being the right winner of the Ballon d’Or and in a way that is not just logical but also redemptive. Dembélé is also a victory for feeling. Like Lamine Yamal he is an exhilarating footballer, blessed with rare technique, a scorer of brilliant goals, and now the dominant attacking presence in PSG’s trans-European treble.

He has done this late in his football life, and done it when he really didn’t have to. A year ago he was out of the PSG team. Three years ago he was being hauled off in a World Cup final after a devastatingly bad 40 minutes. At Barcelona there was a meanness in his characterisation as lazy, disorganised, a junk food product, surrounded by feckless street-kid friends. In this context, the brilliance of his turnaround is that it is born out of hard work, team play, wildly committed pressing and tactical intelligence. It’s a victory for good management. And also for people getting on with each other, for turning the manager who dropped him after a row into the manager who has transformed his professional existence.

Dembélé’s Ballon d’Or says: nothing is set, that it is still possible to reach out into the corners of your own talent. And it is also possible to do this if, like Dembélé, you’re not a conventional alpha sport-dog but someone who has known doubt and uncertainty, who is notoriously wry and funny rather than loud and flash. At the end of which we have a 28‑year‑old man crying at a podium, hugging his mum, showing vulnerability in his moment of straight-line triumph. And doing it all in the middle of the most cynically overmarketed festival of nausea.

Dembélé may or may not be back on that stage, may still be part of a Qatari project in the most gerrymandered league in Europe. But he may also be enough to make you fall back in love, just a little, with this wildly alienating, oddly human sport‑industrial complex.",Ousmane Dembélé’s Ballon d’Or is a human victory amid the toxic theatre of football,sports,Barney Ronay,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/23/ousmane-dembele-ballon-dor-paris-saint-germain-france-lamine-yamal,2025-09-23 00:00:00,"Ousmane Dembélé's win at the Ballon d'Or ceremony stands out amid the spectacle of celebrity culture in football, representing both a personal triumph and a broader narrative of redemption.

"Diminished world championships return fails to cloud Australian optimism Australia’s head of athletic high performance has described Gout Gout’s national debut in Tokyo as “just brilliant” and has defended the team’s overall performance, even though the medal return was down on tallies at the Paris Olympics and at the previous World Athletics Championships in Budapest two years ago.

Australia finished the competition on Sunday with gold in the women’s high jump through Nicola Olyslagers, adding to bronze medals to pole vaulter Kurtis Marschall, javelin thrower Mackenzie Little and Jess Hull, who was on the podium in the 1500m and also made the 800m final. While the tally is down compared to recent major meets, four medals is Australia’s equal second-largest return in world championships history.

Australian Athletics general manager of high performance, Andrew Faichney, said over the nine days of the meet there were strong performances from younger athletes while those four previous medallists delivered again. “That’s a really good return on the back of last year’s performances,” he said. “It might on face value seem like it’s a drop away, [but] we had three medalists or three medals not here as well.”

The team collected six medals in Budapest, and seven in Paris. Only one gold was won at each meet, and in both cases it came from pole vaulter Nina Kennedy who missed Tokyo through injury. Walker Jemima Montag, who won two medals in France, and world indoors silver medallist Lachie Kennedy were also missing.

“All in all, I think it’s been really successful,” Faichney said. “We’ve had a number of our juniors that have been able to come through, get on the team and perform, and so for year one in an Olympic cycle it’s looking very good.”

Asked who he was surprised to see do well, Faichney immediately volunteered the team’s high-profile teenager. “Everyone had so much expectation around Gout, but his performance was just brilliant, really,” Faichney said. “The fact that he was able to perform so well in his heat, get through into the semi and finish strongly in that semi, that was fantastic as a 17-year-old athlete.”

He also spoke glowingly about Claudia Hollingsworth and Abbey Caldwell, who were close to the 800m final, 23-year-old Ky Robinson who finished fourth in the 5000m, and sprinter Torrie Lewis who set two personal best times at the meet.

Faichney defended the relay teams, who struggled with two failed changeovers and one disqualification in six races, saying the programme is at the start of a journey towards the Los Angeles Games.

“If I turned to 2028 and we had this performance, that’d be a different circumstance,” he said. “This year [is the] first year really having a crack at it, it’s been really solid for us to get those teams here.”

Faichney also acknowledged some athletes did not meet their expectations. Highly touted 1500m runner Cameron Myers did not make it out of his heat, nor did national 800m record holder Peter Bol. Long jumper Liam Adcock – seeded No 3 in the world – did not reach the final.

“This is a late championships for us, and we’ve had a competition structure [that includes] our domestic season at the start of the year, and then we came all the way through to September,” he said. “Have we managed that part of it as well as other countries who’ve just come out of the European [summer]? Maybe that is the situation, I think that’s what we’ve got to actually have a look at.”

At 86 athletes, the team was the largest Australian team ever at a world championships and equal largest ever at a global meet. Faichney pushed back on suggestions they were taking too many non-medal contenders.

“It’s a fantastic thing that we’ve got a really large team, and a big part of that size comes out of those relays as well, so I don’t want to forget that,” he said. “Pretty much the last athlete to be selected was Delta Amidzovski, who’s a gold medalist from the World U-20s last year going into the long jump. Absolutely, we want her to be here.”

Gout’s emergence on the world stage was the dominant thread in the storyline of Australia’s championships, but Hull’s competitiveness across both the 1500m and 800m underlined her status of the queen of Australian track.

She said the sport’s momentum will continue into the Glasgow Commonwealth Games next year, the Beijing World Championships in 2027 – which, like this year’s, will be in a timezone friendly for Australian audiences – and through to the 2032 Brisbane Olympics.

“People sometimes forget that athletics is as big as it is,” she said. “I’m sure when they’re watching at home and seeing full stadiums like this, it becomes a bit more meaningful and has a bit more impact, and those tickets in 2032 will be so hotly sought after.”

Hull pledged to be there in Brisbane, when she will be 35, most likely be contesting the 5000m. “I love the sport, I want to be here for a long time and I think leaving that 5k for something beyond LA gives me another life for that next Olympic cycle, especially into the home Olympics.”",Diminished world championships return fails to cloud Australian optimism,sports,Jack Snape,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/22/australia-team-results-performance-world-athletics-championships-2025,2025-09-22 00:00:00,"Australia's performance at the World Athletics Championships was met with optimism despite a lower medal count compared to previous events, with officials praising the emergence of younger athletes.

Australian Athletics officials expressed confidence in the team's development and the importance of building towards the 2028 Olympics.",1,0,1
"Noah Lyles: ‘The future of sprinting is hazy right now. Nobody knows which direction to go in’ Sprint king Noah Lyles sits smiling and calm after the storm that returned him to the throne in Tokyo, reflective even. He has expressed a desire, having now won four successive 200m world titles, to surpass Usain Bolt’s record with a fifth at the World Athletics Championships in Beijing in 2027.

But the American’s mind has wandered even further. “I have a strong blueprint of what I want my last year in the sport to look like,” he says. “I’ve looked pretty far into the future.”

Lyles rules out a tilt for the 2032 Games in Brisbane, when he will be 35, making Los Angeles in 2028 his Olympic swansong. The plan is for a final year “somewhere in between 2028 and 2032”, racing at three meets in countries he’s never been to, “so that I can touch a lot of bucket list things”.

There will also be a few competitions “close to home” and then one final flourish. “The last race would be at my own track meet, where I’d be able to do any and everything that I want.”

He laughs at this thought, a glimpse at the glee Lyles exudes when he is in world-beating form. It’s a contrast from his presence in Japan for the Olympics four years ago, when he was managing depression and finished third in the 200m behind winner Canadian Andre De Grasse.

In a celebratory mood in downtown Tokyo, Lyles takes a question about his advancing years in good humour. “Uh oh, I’m getting up there aren’t I,” the 28-year-old says, chuckling again. “Last year in Paris was the halfway mark for me, literally turning 26 to 27 in Paris, I was like, ‘OK, I’m on the other half of the hill’.”

He says he thinks about his age regularly, in order to make the most of his time in the sport. “If I really push everything I want out of every year and month and week and day that I have, I don’t think I’ll ever regret any of the years.”

View image in fullscreen Lyles blitzed the field to win the men’s 200m final in Tokyo. Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images

This sustained commitment is just about holding the next generation at bay. In the 200m final in Tokyo, Lyles was the second oldest behind only Britain’s Zharnel Hughes. The pair are now outliers increasingly swamped by youth.

Twenty-four-year-old Oblique Seville rumbled to 100m gold in Tokyo, and his countryman Kishane Thompson is the same age. Another Jamaican, Bryan Levell, won bronze behind Lyles at 21, and Letsile Tebogo, the 200m Olympic champion, is still just 22.

Then there are those next in line, including Gout Gout. Lyles knows the Australian better than most, having been connected through the Adidas stable, and the American has not been shy about sharing his opinion of the 17-year-old, the youngest to compete in the 200m in Tokyo, but unable to progress past the semi-finals.

Whether the teenager lives up to his potential, the man with eight world championship golds says, is up to him. “He’s obviously so young, very talented, but there’s so many people who have been talented in our sport that unfortunately haven’t been able to hit that upper echelon,” Lyles says. “It’s more about, what’s the path he’s going to take, who’s the team that he’s going to take with him, and how much work are you going to put into not just being athletic, but knowing that you’ve got to be a businessperson and you’ve got to be it young.”

Despite Gout’s burgeoning profile, his pre-meet exposure for Tokyo was restricted to one media opportunity. The Australian was generous with his time following his elimination, but his light international schedule this year and a patient approach by his coach Di Sheppard and manager James Templeton – as well as Gout’s commitment to his final high school exams next month – has frustrated an athletics community hungry for more of the Brisbane teenager.

“That’s the hardest part about being such a young talent, you have to grow up so much faster than everybody else,” Lyles says. “When people get to come to you and they’re like, ‘hey, we need this of you’, unfortunately you don’t get to say ‘I’m only a teenager’. Because once you sign the contract, once you’re on the track, you’re no longer a teenager, you’re now a businessman.”

That side of the sport comes naturally to Lyles, one of athletics’ most powerful marketing forces. He says he does not have to balance his true self with the showman fans recognise, because those personas are one and the same. “That’s why I have a lot of people who do – and don’t – like me,” he says, that laugh erupting again.

2:38 ‘The future of sprinting is hazy right now', says US sprint king Noah Lyles – video

But he is serious when talking about what comes next for the sport. “The future of sprinting is hazy right now. There is so much talent, there is so much room for growth and there are so many new personalities coming up, but I feel the way that the sport is right now, nobody knows which direction to go in.”

He says it is not just about who will emerge as the next great performers on the track, and that the uncertainty extends to “everything involving athletics”. World Athletics has scheduled a new event next year, the Ultimate Championship, to make up for the absence of a global major in 2026, but Lyles has yet to commit to racing there. The Netflix series Sprint, featuring Lyles and other top sprinters, found an audience but it has not replicated Formula One’s success in cultivating mass appeal through Drive to Survive. There were also high hopes for Michael Johnson’s Grand Slam Track, until it fell into financial ruin.

Lyles, a long-time cheerleader for the sport, says a fear of backlash among athletes and a sometimes-poisonous fan culture is holding the sport back. “Somebody was asking me to give some advice to Letsile [Tebogo] and I was like, ‘to be honest, you’ve just got to be yourself’,” he says.

“We want to come out here and be showmen and give our greatest performances, but we also want to be ourselves, and I think that sometimes we’re not allowed to be ourselves out of fear of how people will perceive us, knowing that this is just a sport. It’s just a sport, guys, nobody’s dying at the end of the day. Let’s enjoy these moments as much as possible.”",Noah Lyles: ‘The future of sprinting is hazy right now. Nobody knows which direction to go in’,sports,Jack Snape,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/22/noah-lyles-athlete-interview-future-of-sprinting-hazy-gout-maturity-uncertainty,2025-09-22 00:00:00,"Noah Lyles, the reigning sprint king, reflects on his successful career and future aspirations, including a desire to win a fifth consecutive 200m world title in 2027.

Christmas will be cancelled unless they replace that artificial tree) and another had a hefty plant pot, with plant still attached, drop on his car from two stories up (Allegedly. I say allegedly, having surveyed the damage, that’s what I think happened) to leave a sizable dent in the roof and a terminal crack in his windscreen. Overall, we got away with it quite lightly. “Having said that, if some genius on the OBO can explain, I’d love to know why Ragasa, the biggest tropical storm in the world this year, only uprooted trees, whereas six years ago Typhoon Mangkhut took mature trees and twisted their trunks halfway up as if they were matchsticks. “Anyway, the point of all of this drivel is to ask one simple question: is it really so difficult for English cricket to ensure that all of the counties have access to their best players for the T20 final and the promotion/relegation/championship deciders? “It’s obviously not a simple question. Because Sport 101 - the simplest, most rudimentary rules of running a competition - is to know what next year’s competitions are going to look like BEFORE you start this year’s. Anything else is utterly confusing, distracting and divisive. “Obviously, they couldn’t do that, but still, having the season’s success and failures decided by teams half-filled with players from “The Stiffs” is in no-one’s best interests, is it?

You don’t just get cricket on this blog, you get emotional scars, too. And that relegation cannot yet be discounted. Yorkshire might have dominated much of the first day against Durham, their rivals in distress, but Ben Raine’s doughty assault against the second new ball (87 not out from 85 balls) sees Durham resume on 322-7 and not too far off parity.

2h ago 19.01 AEST Thursday’s roundup As the season’s last round of championship cricket rolled around, players paid tribute to Dickie Bird, who died on Tuesday, aged 92. At his spiritual home, Headingley, a minute’s applause was observed, the players lining up on the pitch, and a bouquet of flowers and trademark umpire’s white cap placed on Bird’s dressing‑room balcony chair. Bird, who funded the balcony in 2015, would have enjoyed the first five overs of the day when Yorkshire reduced their fellow relegation candidates Durham to seven for two, but 93 from David Bedingham and an unbeaten 87 from Ben Raine turned the tables. Yorkshire need eight more points to be sure of Division One cricket next year, Durham may require a win because of Surrey’s impression of a soggy paper bag at the hands of fellow strugglers Hampshire. Surrey, champions for three years on the bounce, needed a maximum point win to put pressure on the leaders, Nottinghamshire. But, albeit with a side weakened by illness and the withdrawal of England players, they were dismissed for just 147, their lowest total of the season. Dan Lawrence top scored with 36. There were three wickets each for James Fuller, Washington Sundar and Kyle Abbott, who passed fifty wickets for the summer for the sixth time. Hampshire then sailed calmly to a seven-run lead at stumps. All of which was music to the ears of Nottinghamshire, who bowled out Warwickshire for 258 in a frenetic last session and now need just two more points – 300 runs – to secure the title. Warwickshire had revived at 244 for five but lost their last five wickets for 14 runs, Dan Mousley last man out for 74. Elsewhere, Steve Eskinazi made a first century for Leicestershire against Northamptonshire, Middlesex’s captain, Leus du Plooy, biffed an unbeaten 171 against Gloucestershire, the Somerset academy graduate Josh Thomas hit a run-a-ball fifty on his championship debut proper, and James Rew his fifth 50 of the summer to frustrate Essex, who remain in relegation danger. After a season of wrangling, meetings, more meetings, letters and votes, the England and Wales Cricket Board announced that the motion to remodel the County Championship structure had not received the required two-thirds majority of votes it needed to pass. The 18 first-class counties were tied at 9-9, which means the current two-division 14-game, two up, two down, competition remains. The announcement drew an immediate retort from the Professional Cricketers’ Association. The union’s chief executive, Daryl Mitchell, said the current structure was “not fit for purpose,” while its chair, Olly Hannon-Dalby, said: “Over the past two years, we have seen increasing levels of genuine concern for player health and wellbeing and as an association we represented this in the strongest possible way. Ultimately the required minimum number of 12 county chairs did not see player welfare as a priority.” Share

"Zohran Mamdani’s Fifa fight is a blueprint for the left to re-engage with sports If Zohran Mamdani had not intended it as a campaigning opportunity, he probably wouldn’t have worn a full suit – the universal candidate’s uniform. But there he was, the 33-year-old Democratic nominee for November’s New York City mayoral election; the upstart democratic socialist who has stormed on to the national stage with a wildfire campaign on an unabashedly progressive platform of affordability in one of the world’s most expensive cities. Last Sunday, he mingled in an Arsenal bar in Brooklyn, flanked by fellow Gooner Spike Lee, peering at the big screen with a solemnity befitting the showdown with Manchester City.

Mamdani is the overwhelming favorite in the race to run the United States’ largest city, sitting 15 points clear of his nearest rival, Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani is potentially New York’s first Muslim mayor. And also its first soccer mayor.

He has waded into those waters repeatedly in the last few weeks. He launched a petition pushing back against Fifa’s dynamic pricing model for tickets at the 2026 World Cup, and demanding a price cap on resale tickets and an affordable allotment reserved for local residents. He announced the news through another of his instantly viral videos, flashing the social media savvy and political acuity that excites his supporters so much, along with a surprisingly soft touch on the ball. Then he appeared on the Guardian’s Football Weekly podcast.

There’s some political theater to this, of course. Mamdani’s petition is a very, very long shot to change Fifa’s policy, even if he wins the election, as is expected. The petition’s signup page on his website includes a handy box you can check to pledge to his campaign. But Mamdani was shrewd enough to understand that Fifa was there to be dunked on, and that the expected hyperinflation on World Cup tickets – America’s disposable income is why the sport has moved so many signature events stateside, after all – dovetailed nicely with his affordability agenda.

Besides, Mamdani made a good point by highlighting that tickets for the World Cup matches staged in Mexico do have a cap on resale pricing, thanks to exactly the type of government policy he espouses. It isn’t such a long ideological leap for the candidate promising free bus fares and childcare, city-owned grocery stores, rent freezes, and a $30-per-hour minimum wage, to plead for New Yorkers to be able to attend World Cup games in their own backyard.

Mamdani treading into a kind of soccer populism, however, is less interesting for the impact it may have on the sport than the distinct possibility that he’s happened upon an untapped and useful force in American politics.

For a great many years, major figures on the right have cloaked themselves in America’s favorite sports as a means of connecting with voters. George W Bush was an unrepentant sports nut, and a onetime owner of MLB’s Texas Rangers. John McCain was forever calling into sports talk radio shows. Mitt Romney was quick to remind the nation of his role in rescuing the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics from failure in 2002. Sarah Palin styled herself as the nation’s “hockey mom.”

And then there’s Donald Trump, who has embraced sports fully and leverages them constantly to score political points. He lambasted the NFL when much of the league kneeled during the national anthem in a reckoning with racism. Trump’s first vice-president, Mike Pence, went to an NFL game only to summarily walk out when the players kneeled, as expected.

Trump criticized the Cleveland Guardians for changing their name, blaming “cancel culture.” He turned up at an Atlanta Braves game just to do the racist tomahawk chop. He became the first sitting US president to attend a Super Bowl, between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles in February – even though Trump has historically been foggy on which the state the Chiefs are from (Arrowhead Stadium is in Missouri, for the record). Trump retains close ties to the New York Yankees ownership. He has boasted of great baseball talent in his youth – although this was a brazen lie. He showed up to tennis’ US Open and was greeted with a chorus of boos, and will pop into this week’s Ryder Cup as well.

There’s even a plausible theory out there that Trump only ever ran for president because he’d been spurned by the NFL’s club of owners, a group he was desperate to belong to, when he attempted to buy the Buffalo Bills. True or not, it’s clear that sports are essential to Trump’s political aims.

By contrast, Democratic party leaders have largely kept sports at arm’s length for the last decade. Barack Obama was a notable exception – he made sure to be seen playing enough basketball to litter the internet with compilation reels and even And1-style mixtapes, the better to distract from how much he liked to golf, or how bad he was at bowling. (Albeit not nearly as bad as George HW Bush.) Obama was the first president to publicize his own March Madness bracket. But the long-running custom of presidential nominees of the major parties cozying up to sports, in whatever way they could, ended on one side of the aisle. Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris mostly left sports alone.

Wittingly or not, Mamdani has spotted an opening to tether the left to sports. And with American football, baseball and basketball feeling all tapped out for political clout, soccer – whose American fans seem to skew progressive anyway – is an ideal foil for his platform. What sport, after all, better embodies unfettered, latter-day capitalism and its parasitical relationship with its own customer base than soccer? What sport works harder at making itself unaffordable to its traditional fanbase? Where else will Mamdani find better similes for his kitchen-table issues?

Tax the rich? Let us now speak of the world’s richest sport, wherein everybody likes to dodge their taxes.

There are limitations, of course, to how much a young, future mayor – maybe, probably – can budge his party in an ossified landscape dominated by a stubborn class of elders. But if nothing else, Mamdani might write a new playbook, or at least a new play or two, to get the left back into the conversation around sports.",Zohran Mamdani’s Fifa fight is a blueprint for the left to re-engage with sports,sports,Leander Schaerlaeckens,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/25/zohran-mamdani-fifa-left-progressive-politics-sports,2025-09-25 00:00:00,"Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, is leveraging his campaign to advocate for affordable sports access, particularly targeting FIFA's pricing for the 2026 World Cup.

"Premiership Rugby in talks to stage league match at Chicago Cubs’ Wrigley Field Premiership Rugby is in talks about staging a game at Wrigley Field in Chicago next season, the first attempt to move a game abroad since Saracens played Newcastle in Philadelphia in 2017.

The eye-catching plan to hold a game at Chicago Cubs’ famous home would be a significant boost to rugby union in the United States, hosts of the 2031 Rugby World Cup.

Premiership Rugby has rebranded the competition as the Gallagher Prem for this season, which begins with Gloucester’s trip to Sale on Thursday evening, and is actively courting investment from America.

The title sponsors are commercial partners of Major League Baseball’s Chicago Cubs and their Wrigley Field, where part of the ballpark is known as Gallagher Way.

The Guardian has learned that Premiership Rugby has had discussions about taking a game to Wrigley Field during the 2026-27 season. It would coincide with the 100th anniversary of Gallagher, a Chicago-based insurance company. Gallagher and the Cubs are understood to be receptive, while numerous Prem clubs would be interested despite the need to sacrifice a home fixture.

Premiership Rugby engaged New York-based bank Raine Group and accountants Deloitte earlier this year with a brief to attract new investors, specifically from the United States. They ran the Hundred £520m auction for the England and Wales Cricket Board in January, so have a track record of delivering investment in English sport.

Raine Group and Deloitte are understood to have been told to market both the Prem as a competition and seek stakes in individual English clubs. The Austrian energy drinks company Red Bull bought Newcastle Falcons last summer, while the Jordan Group has agreed to buy London Irish, who are hoping to rejoin the new second-tier Champ next season.

"Wayne Rooney says wife Coleen saved his life amid problems with alcohol The former England and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney believes his wife, Coleen, helped save his life by managing his problems with alcohol.

The 39-year-old, United’s record goalscorer, says he was “struggling massively” with his drinking during his playing career and admits he would often do it for two straight days.

“I honestly believe if she weren’t there I’d be dead,” he told the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast. “I’ve made mistakes in the past which are well documented and whatever but I’m a little bit different at times and she keeps me on that path and she’s done it for 20-odd years.

“I wanted to go out and enjoy my time with my friends and have a night out. It got to a point where I went too far – that was a moment in my life where I was struggling massively with alcohol. I didn’t think I could turn to anyone. I didn’t really want to because I didn’t want to put that burden on anyone.

“I just drank for two days straight. Come training and at the weekend I’d score two goals and then I’d go back and go and drink for two days straight again. She’s helped me control that massively. She’s managed me because I needed managing.”

"What makes a good women’s football stadium? Everton point the way “It was a pitch in the middle of a park, basically,” Peter McFarlane, secretary of the Everton Women Official Supporters’ Club, says in describing Walton Hall Park, the 500-seat stadium that eventually held a further 1500 spectators before the team moved to Goodison Park.

Walton Hall Park was the smallest stadium in the Women’s Super League, charming and nostalgic with its railed-off standing space, somewhat isolated outside of the city, and otherwise simply lacking food options and a bar. “It’s worlds apart compared to what Goodison offers us,” McFarlane says. “I mean, it helps we have a roof for the fans.”

If design becomes most beautiful when its form follows function, stadiums can be reworked for different demographics. The relatively new access to large stadiums for women’s football raises questions about how to use these new environments for new audiences. “For a men’s fixture, the routine is familiar: people get there the same way, go to the same pubs with their same friends and then go to the games, with all their rituals,” says Charlotte Read, a senior consultant at Steer, a company that advises organisations such as the Football Association on matchday operations. “For a women’s fixture you have a lot more women and families, or first-time fans. You tend to get earlier arrivals for weekend fixtures. They want to make it an all-day thing.”

Goodison Park, in contrast to Walton Hall Park, is monolithic, industrial, cosied in streets of sprawled-out amenities, well walked by generations of Evertonians. Since Everton Women’s first fixture at the repurposed venue, on 14 September, it has been rejuvenated by fanzones offering face-painting, beer and music. There are even bottomless brunches in what used to be named the Dixie Dean suite. At that first WSL game against Tottenham, 6,473 fans attended, almost triple their previous ground’s capacity. For their second game, last Friday against London City Lionesses, it was 4,313.

Central to the way stadium space is understood in the UK is the Sports Ground Safety Authority’s Green Guide. Established in 1973, and despite its non-statutory status, it is a world-leading influence on venue safety. The issue with renewed demands on stadiums is that these stadium design guidelines have been based on the average male height, and average male preferences, for decades. The next iteration of the document, which will “incorporate larger consideration for female spectators”, is due for the 2028-29 season.

The Taylor Report made British stadiums the global standard and in turn developed a new relationship between fans and football venues for mass consumption. “The old model of a stadium, where it is used 25 times a year, doesn’t work anymore,” says Edward Robinson, an associate director at Steer.

“In the men’s game it’s about increasing spend per head. The women’s game is in a different place; it’s much more about bums on seats. You not only need to retain the existing audience, you need people to convert from ‘this was a nice day out we did once’ to ‘we are going to come every two weeks’. So it needs to be a really good experience.”

Steer’s recent report on the differing demographics attending women’s games argues that stadium organisation, turnstile-processing times, seat configurations and facilities in general are generally inadequate for women’s football fanbases. “In the women’s game, people don’t put up with the same level of discomfort that people just expect from the men’s game,” Robinson says. “Men’s football crowds are much more comfortable standing at much higher densities than women’s. That impacts how much queuing space you need to design. If you have a four-year-old, you’re not going to shove them into someone else’s crotch just to squeeze in.”

The typical 70:30 male-to-female split of toilets in stadiums has led to long queues and requires costly solutions for clubs. Other equitable facilities, like baby-changing or breastfeeding rooms, as well as buggy parks, something Manchester City introduced at the start of this season, are also essential for the future.

As part of the expected 11 spectators-per-minute-through-turnstiles outlined in the Green Guide, the consideration of extra bags for women or family essential items is unaddressed, being based on male crowds. The increase in group tickets, usually on one parent’s phone, is similarly unaccounted for in queuing times. Similarly, social scripts surrounding a stadium, from direction to security presence, are rarely ingrained into crowds at women’s games.

“You now have people coming in that haven’t done the routine before,” Read says. “For families and women, from a safety perspective, it’s important for stewards and signage just to show you are going in the right direction or there are people there.”

Matches in the UK have traditionally been assigned risk ratings in a tiered system, agreed with police based on the level of antisocial behaviour and violence expected. These measures also don’t translate for the heightened sensitivity of safeguarding women and children. “That way of rating things is quite outdated. For the women’s game, it needs to shift,” Robinson says.

“It’s not about having fewer stewards; it’s that their focus is less on confiscating cocaine and booze and more on safeguarding. It’s about making sure kids are OK and happy, and setting a more welcoming atmosphere as people arrive. It’s a different briefing.”

Women’s Professional Leagues Limited, which runs the WSL and WSL2, have partnered with AFL Architects to produce a report into matchday operational standards. It was due in August and no update has been given on when it will be available. The next few months are likely to see further in-depth plans for Brighton’s custom-built stadium, expected in 2027, the first in England to be built for a professional women’s team.

In America, the newly crowned National Women’s Soccer League Shield winners, Kansas City Current, moved into the first purpose-built stadium for a women’s team last year. Specific alterations include universal changing rooms, nursing stations and gender-inclusive bathrooms. “The design of women’s stadiums must move beyond symbolism and deliver spaces that genuinely meet the needs of female athletes and fans,” says Jessica Roberts, an Australian academic in sports fan engagement. “These aren’t luxuries but the foundation of professional legitimacy, ensuring women’s teams are not treated as temporary guests in male-dominated venues.”

In other stadium redevelopments, inclusive spaces such as dedicated sensory rooms are being implemented. Yet while the spatial, planning, and financial requirements of starting from scratch present logistical challenges, clubs can still respond to changing demographics arriving through their gates. And some clubs are more proactive than others. Despite dominating English women’s football on the pitch, Chelsea have shown less ambition in a cohesive partnership with Stamford Bridge than Arsenal have with the Emirates Stadium. West Ham Women, meanwhile, last played at the London Stadium in 2019.

“It’s about the ownership,” says Zoe Draper, the vice-chair of Arsenal Women’s Supporters’ Club. “Meadow Park [Arsenal’s previous WSL home] is owned by Boreham Wood. They made it red-and-white branded with some signs, but the Emirates is home. Arsenal feels like a cohesive club; the women’s team are represented.”

At Everton, there have been no large-scale changes to Goodison. Instead there have been more visual and explanatory reclaimants of the space and history, as well as a promise of patience. And speaking to fans, there is a sense of agency in the active reimagination and responsibility of what the modern women’s football stadium could be for future generations. “With Everton, it’s going to be a lot of trial and error,” McFarlane says. “The club want to know what is keeping you, but also why, if people don’t come back, the reasons for it. We’ve got a big role to play in Goodison Park over the coming years.”

Everton Women Official Supporters’ Club have claimed the Winslow pub on County Road, a renowned haunt for supporters of the men’s team for years, for fans of the women’s team, setting up shop for pre-match catch-ups and a table of merchandise. “So much of the matchday routine is meeting up with people; the community of our supporters club is as important as the match itself,” McFarlane says.

“They club have done a good job of putting the women’s club stamp on Goodison Park without fundamentally changing it. It’s important now that we embrace the history and try to add our own.”

"Ekitiké joins another red family: prematurely disrobing before an early bath A PROPER SHIRT SHOW

If you’re going to plagiarise you might as well copy from the best, but when Hugo Ekitiké decided to pay homage to Lionel Messi by replicating one of the Argentinian’s more iconic celebrations, his tribute came at a cost to Liverpool. While Messi famously wheeled away in celebration, removed his shirt and pointedly held it up in front of the Bernabéu crowd after scoring a late, late winner for Barcelona in a five-goal thriller at Real Madrid in 2017, Ekitiké has now rather more infamously done the same thing after scoring a tap-in from an excellent Federico Chiesa assist against Championship opposition in the third round of Fizzy Cup. And while both players were routinely shown yellow cards for what has now been a bookable offence for more than 20 years, at least the one brandished in the direction of Messi was only his first of the match, so he wasn’t sent off.

“The first one was already needless and, to a certain extent, stupid, as you have got to control your emotions,” seethed Arne Slot of the first yellow his striker was shown for an act of dissent. “With the second one I told him that if you score in the [Bigger Cup] final in the 87th minute after outplaying three players and hitting it in the top corner … I can maybe understand he is like: ‘This is all about me.’ But I’m old-fashioned. If I scored a goal like this I’d have walked up to Federico Chiesa and said: ‘This goal is all about you, this is not about me.’ Needless, not smart … I called it stupid right away.” While the price of Ekitiké’s act of over-exuberance is a one-match ban that rules him out of Liverpool’s trip to Crystal Palace this weekend, he may find himself on the periphery for longer now that Alexander Isak has opened his account for the Reds and is fast approaching full fitness.

Issuing an apology on Social Media Disgrace Instachat that could scarcely have been more sheepish if had been covered in wool while being herded into a pen by a border collie, Ekitiké explained that “the emotion got the better of me tonight” and issued multiple “apologies to all the Red family”. In the fullness of time, when it’s OK for him to look back and laugh at his own tomfoolery, he may even take perverse pleasure in discovering he has become a member of a different kind of “red family” – specifically one whose members also forgot they had already been booked before deciding to disrobe as part of late goal celebrations.

Last year, Amad Diallo was dismissed in similar circumstances after scoring Manchester United’s winner in an FA Cup quarter-final against Liverpool, while Cameroon’s Vincent Aboubakar also received his marching orders for taking off his shirt in celebration after scoring what would prove to be the only goal of the game for Cameroon against Brazil at the last World Cup. Despite seeing his Southampton side lose 2-1 at Anfield, Will Still was certainly able to see the funny side of the early departure of a young player he knows from his days at Reims. “Hugo cracks me up,” he honked. “He’s a funny lad. We caught up before the game, and he said he’d come on and score and then give me a shirt and bugger off, which is exactly what he’s done.”

I am already bored with the current trend of Liverpool grabbing a winner by way of a late goal in so many games. The ‘will they/won’t they’ has all but disappeared and jeopardy is obviously important as a neutral. The predictability is on a par with an episode of Columbo. As the viewer, already party to the guest star character’s guilt, you know that Columbo is absolutely going to nail the killer with a novel demonstration of how they committed their supposed ‘perfect murder’. Liverpool now allow teams to believe they have snatched a very hard and well-earned point before turning to them in the dying seconds and saying: ‘Oh, just one more thing …’ Perhaps the opposition managers should be replaced by stars such as William Shatner or Faye Dunaway (not many other former Columbo guest stars survive) – Tony Forrest.

We don’t just want the best product or service; we want to know we’re choosing a business that reflects our values and considers its impact on the world.

It’s not always easy to know which companies are doing the right thing. But fortunately, there’s one big green flag to look for: B Corporation (or ‘B Corp’) certification.

B Corp certification isn’t just some rubber stamp or social lip service; it’s the result of a real process that requires applicant businesses to prove they meet stringent criteria.

“Certified B Corps are businesses that are verified by B Lab to meet high standards of environmental and social performance across five impact areas, agree to be transparent about this performance, and commit to accountability to all stakeholders,” says Cameron Foley, the community impact manager with internet service provider Aussie Broadband.

Those impact areas are governance (including the company’s mission, ethics and transparency); workers (a commitment to policies that benefit workers); community (including overall community impact, diversity and charitable giving); environment (including how the business approaches environmental management practices and its impact on air, climate, water, land and biodiversity); and customers (including product quality and the ethical treatment of customers).

While a business can hold itself to these standards independently, B Corp certification offers clear goalposts, community transparency and authenticity, which Foley says is vital for today’s socially minded consumers.

“Consumers that are drawn to purpose-driven companies view their purchases as an extension of their identity, and as a result they want to do business with companies that reflect their ethics, their views on sustainability, and social justice,” he says. “They want to know that the company they are supporting is authentic and not simply greenwashing.”

Aussie Broadband, B Corp

One business living its values is Foley’s employer, Aussie Broadband. Over an 18-month process, it undertook an assessment that included more than 200 detailed questions about the business and its operations, and it is required to resubmit for certification every three years. It’s a complex, time-consuming process, but it’s one that Foley says is critical for Aussie Broadband in demonstrating its core values to its customers.

“For many years now, one of our company values has always been ‘be good to people’,” Foley says. “But it doesn’t just mean being good to our people; we want to leave a positive impact on our customers, the communities in which we live and operate, and the world in which our customers live, too.”

For Aussie Broadband, this has meant taking greater initiative to drive change as a newly crowned B Corp. Foley says the business has since accelerated its transition to 100% renewable energy on its owned and operated sites, and begun using the Givvable platform to track the environmental credentials of its supply chain partners. Considering the potential for e-waste in the telco industry, Aussie Broadband has also partnered with Zolo to recycle and repurpose devices such as laptops and modems.

On the social side, Aussie Broadband has expanded its charity product discount program, Helping Communities Connect. The initiative, which now supports more than 1,100 partners, offers discounts and digital empowerment to charities, not-for-profits and Indigenous-owned businesses.

Be good to people

As we head into an increasingly digital future, the businesses that facilitate the transition will only grow in importance. Choosing utilities such as the internet is no longer just about getting great service, world-class speeds and value for money. Foley says mindful consumers are looking hard for companies that reflect their core beliefs, such as greater care for the environment, society and employees.

“There is a growing number of environmentally and socially conscious consumers who highly value purpose-driven businesses that take care of their people and the places in which they operate,” Foley says.

“Consumers want companies to hold themselves to a high standard, and to be transparent and accountable about their impact on the environment and society.”

"The red-tailed black cockatoo: a sign of hope in the Wimmera The silhouette of a flock of south-eastern red-tailed black cockatoos cutting across the Wimmera sky was probably once a more common sight. But for decades, these endangered birds have struggled to find the stringybark and slow-growing buloke trees that sustain them.

It was read as a sign of hope, then, when they were spotted feeding on the stringybark revegetation in Bank Australia’s conservation reserve on Wotjobaluk Country in western Victoria. Spread across four properties outside Horsham, the 2,117-hectare reserve is the home of a long-term effort to restore native plants and provide habitat for native animals.

Caring for country, culture and community

The customer-owned Bank Australia acquired the first of the four properties in 2008, as a practical step towards acting on customers’ concerns about climate change and the protection of nature. The reserve has been managed in partnership with not-for-profit conservation organisations including Greening Australia. Its management is now led by Trust for Nature, in collaboration with traditional owners from the Wotjobaluk, Jaadwa, Jadawadjali, Wergaia, and Jupagulk peoples, represented by the Barengi Gadjin Land Council (BGLC).

With the help of the BGLC and the Country Fire Authority, the traditional land-care strategy of cultural burning has been reintroduced. These cool, low-intensity fires eliminate invasive weeds, encourage the growth of native grasses and reshape habitats to support native animal life.

Conservationists, ecologists, community groups and schools have also participated in the project since its inception.

Signs of hope

The restoration efforts are showing signs of success, demonstrated by the results of a biodiversity survey conducted in 2022-23. Red-tailed black cockatoos were among 283 native animal species identified in the survey, up from 229 recorded in a survey five years earlier. Among those most recently counted were nine threatened animal species, including the Australasian bittern.

The diversity and abundance of bird populations is another sign that ecosystems are recovering, signalling the abundance of available food and shelter; 113 bird species were detected in the 2023 survey, including 22 recorded for the first time on the reserve.

Canopies in revegetated woodlands on the conservation reserve increased by about 20% over the five years between surveys, enhancing the habitat for native animals such as the western pygmy possum.

Commitment for the long term

As well as continuing restoration efforts, it’s equally important to protect the reserve’s older, original vegetation, the survey says. The remnant woodlands have greater structural complexity, and lots of tree hollows, providing vital shelter and protection for small animals.

With tree canopies reaching maturity, efforts can now be focused on promoting greater diversity on the forest floor, improving habitat availability for invertebrates, reptiles and other ground-dwelling species.

Bank Australia has made a commitment to protect nature. The reserve is permanently protected under a conservation covenant with Trust for Nature, which acts as a guarantee for intragenerational responsibility. It’s a binding safeguard that will protect what we have, while work continues to regenerate nature for the future.

"How a legal counsel took a leap into tech leadership With a demanding role as an in-house legal counsel and three children under the age of six, Rachel Debeck already had her hands full when she made the decision to enrol in a master of business administration (MBA) at Macquarie Business School. But it wasn’t the workload she felt most unsure about.

“Stepping into a business-focused degree from a legal background was daunting because I didn’t have that career experience in finance or economics,” says Debeck, now the CEO of Flexischools, a technology platform that provides cashless payments and food ordering solutions to Australian schools. “Having previously completed an undergrad arts-law degree, I was apprehensive about how I would find statistics and other data-heavy subjects.”

But with her sights set on realising her potential beyond the legal profession and into leadership roles in purpose-driven tech businesses, Debeck knew she’d need to take a substantial leap outside her comfort zone. With its mix of core business disciplines and human-centred leadership, the Macquarie Business School MBA would be a bridge to Debeck’s transformational career move.

“For me, it wasn’t about wanting to climb a career ladder or about the next promotion,” she says. “It was really about taking quite a different career path. I saw the MBA as a clear step that I could take to transition from my legal career and help build my commercial confidence, expand my skill set and prepare myself for roles where I could help to shape and grow businesses.”

Turning a gap into an advantage

Debeck acknowledges that her career path is “not necessarily orthodox”, but to her surprise, what she had perceived to be a possible shortcoming turned out to be an asset to her studies.

“Diverse professional backgrounds are actually a real strength in an MBA environment, and the program is designed to bring everyone along regardless of where they’ve started,” she says. Debeck’s legal background gave her “quite a structured analytical approach to solving problems”, which she applied equally well to subjects ranging from financial management to ethics.

Previous senior roles had also given Debeck an opportunity to develop skills working across broad stakeholder groups – including board members, executives and frontline teams – and she was able to leverage this experience in group-based projects within the MBA.

“When collaborating, navigating different perspectives and trying to bring everyone to a consensus, those sorts of skills were really key,” Debeck says. Even so, collaborating with peers from diverse backgrounds and industries was eye-opening. “It’s fascinating to see how differently everyone thinks about a problem and then how they execute on it. It’s helped me to be a better leader today.”

There were still challenges, of course – Debeck recalls an early group assessment in marketing and “flexing that creative side” as being “very uncomfortable” – but she says she felt fully supported for the duration of her MBA.

“It never felt like I was on my own trying to figure things out. There was always support around the assessments, the group work and the content itself. It gave me some really good skills, but it also built my confidence.”

The flexible study options offered by the Macquarie Business School MBA meant Debeck also felt supported time-wise. She completed the course over three years, during which time she was able to “flex up and down” her studies around other work and family commitments.

“Some semesters I did the weekend intensives, which were done over a couple of weekends; in other semesters, I completed subjects in the evening once a week. I was able to tailor it to what I needed, rather than feeling like I had to fit my life and work schedule into a rigid MBA.”

From specialist to strategic leader

Nine years after graduating, Debeck says the MBA has “taken me to a place that I otherwise wouldn’t have been”. As a CEO, she regularly uses her toolkit of skills in finance, economics and data analytics, but equally values the soft skills she learnt along the way, including leadership, strategic planning and building high-performing teams.

“My journey was such that it helped me make the jump from being seen as a legal expert who could also do other things, to entering the tech and innovation industry and becoming a leader with a much broader view, who is responsible for people, product, customers and growth.

“It was one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve had. If an MBA is something you want to do, there is a way to make it happen. You can do it at your own pace and in a way that allows you to get from it what you want to get.

“If you’re interested in learning and you want to be able to either reshape your career path or enter new industries, education is a fantastic way to do it, and Macquarie does it really well.”

"Rob Key insists Brook’s England promotion is not ‘scheme’ to oust Pope Rob Key has all but confirmed Chris Woakes has played his last game for England and insisted Harry Brook’s promotion to vice-captain for the Ashes is not “an elaborate scheme” to oust Ollie Pope from the team.

Speaking a day after naming a 16‑man squad to take on Australia, Key, the team director, clarified the selections – not least the late switch in deputy for Ben Stokes – and confirmed Woakes missed out because of the dislocated shoulder sustained during the final Test of the summer.

But with Woakes now 36 and his central contract not being renewed this October, an England career of nearly 15 years – during which he won two World Cups and was named Ashes player of the series in 2023 – appears to be over. If so, the final act was bravely walking out to bat in a sling at the Oval.

“It’s been as tough a time for someone,” Key said. “In cricket terms, it is the timing of it as much as anything else and the chance of reoccurrence [of the injury]. He was running out of time to be ready for the start of the Ashes. Then once you get out of an Ashes series you’re often looking at the next cycle, really. So Chris Woakes isn’t in our plans at the minute.”

If Woakes’s injury underlined the unforgiving nature of international sport, the same can be said of Pope’s removal as vice-captain. After three years in the role, the demotion comes on the eve of an Ashes tour that will define the Test project under Key, Stokes and the head coach, Brendon McCullum.

Key insisted it came down to Brook, the white-ball captain, simply being a better leader but is aware that, with Jacob Bethell’s star on the rise, he has reopened pandora’s box as regards the debate around the No 3 spot. Pope, who he said was at ease with the call, was given no assurances, however.

“We think now is the right time,” Key said. “It’s pretty simple, really. When Popey has [captained], he’s done it well. He’s fitted into so many different roles. Harry Brook is just the better leader and will be the better leader going forward, so that’s why he gets that job.

“There is not like an elaborate scheme where if we take the vice‑captaincy off Ollie Pope it makes him easier to drop. It doesn’t matter if you are vice-captain or not. If we don’t feel you are the right person – whether that’s an opener or No 5 – we’ll bring in someone we think can do the job better.

“At the moment, Ollie Pope is the man in possession [at No 3]. There is a white-ball series [against New Zealand] that Jacob Bethell is playing in, things like that. You never make your decisions too early because things happen. We tend to leave the decisions as late as possible.”

When asked if Brook was therefore the next Test captain, Key replied: “Who knows? I might not be in this job when that decision is made.”

Regarding Will Jacks, who returns as the second spinner, Key said this came down to being an off-spinner, the fact he will not be “overawed” if called upon, and the flexibility his batting offers should injury dictate a reshuffle. The expectation, however, is that seamers will dominate the wicket charts.

On that score Key expressed no concerns about Mark Wood’s inclusion after knee surgery and a year without first-class cricket, citing his record of building towards Test matches through training. If fit, Wood will augment an attack that, with Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Byrdon Carse and Josh Tongue, is already blessed with more pace than witnessed on previous tours.

Key said: “I’m probably more excited than anybody who has to face them. We’ve worked so hard to get to this point. This is the last little step, get it right and hopefully we have every option available to us going into that first Test. That may be Wood and Archer together, it may not.

“But to have that battery of bowlers, every one of them fit … fingers crossed, but that is the exciting thing. I think this is a bowling attack on the up.”",Rob Key insists Brook’s England promotion is not ‘scheme’ to oust Pope,sports,Ali Martin,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/24/rob-key-harry-brooks-chris-woakes-ollie-pope-england-ashes,2025-09-24 00:00:00,"Rob Key, England's team director, confirmed that Chris Woakes is likely finished with international cricket due to injury and age, while Harry Brook's promotion to vice-captain is not part of a plan to remove Ollie Pope from the team.

"Postecoglou inspired by Nottingham Forest history for Europa League tilt Ange Postecoglou has said Nottingham Forest’s return to Europe rewards dreamers and their rise encapsulates “what football was always designed to be”.

Forest’s Europa League opener at Real Betis on Wednesday is their first competitive match on the continental stage since March 1996, when they lost in the Uefa Cup quarter-finals to Bayern Munich.

Only four years ago Forest were 23rd in the Championship and Postecoglou, who lifted the Europa League trophy with Tottenham in May, said the club being in the competition enticed him to the job.

Asked about the club’s journey to this point, the Forest head coach said: “Amazing. It is brilliant. It is what football was always designed to be … if you dream and you do things well, then you can reach the absolute pinnacle of whatever endeavour you’re in.”

Forest supporters have travelled in their thousands to Spain – officially, Forest have 3,385 tickets – to witness their return to Europe, some of whom likely saw the club win the European Cup in 1979 and 1980.

“I said it when I was at Celtic too, when a club’s got a couple of stars on its badges, it’s special,” the Australian said. “Because you only earn them one way, and that is by winning a European Cup or a Champions League. You literally can’t buy that. You have to earn that.

“I think when you carry something like that on your shirt, you can tap into it, because it shows you that there’s the possibility of success if you dream of it and work hard for it. When you go out there, you’re representing not just today’s fans and today’s players, but also those in the past that have got you to where you are today.”

Almost the entire Forest squad have travelled to Seville, including the ineligible record signing, Omari Hutchinson, who was omitted from the 22-man squad submitted by Postecoglou’s predecessor, Nuno Espírito Santo.

Oleksandr Zinchenko, originally left out by Forest, has replaced Ola Aina in the squad after the club applied to Uefa given the Nigeria full-back is sidelined for three months. Murillo trained on Monday but has not travelled to Spain.

The 72-year-old Manuel Pellegrini will be in the opposite dugout to Postecoglou at the Estadio La Cartuja, Betis’s temporary home during rebuilding work. Pellegrini guided Betis to the Conference League final last season, which they lost to Chelsea.

“Huge respect for Mr Pellegrini,” Postecoglou said. “I’m not going to mention his age, but he just keeps going, he’s a quality manager and he gives hope for young 60-year-olds like me that we’ve still got some football in us.

"Sydney’s Burwood and North Melbourne among world’s coolest neighbourhoods, Time Out says One of Sydney’s most culturally diverse suburbs has made it on to Time Out’s annual 39 coolest neighbourhoods list.

Burwood, it seems, has come a long way since Frank Lowy opened his first Westfield shopping complex on its main street in the mid 1960s.

The inner west suburb was ranked 16th in the world, beating other more globally renowned neighbourhoods such as Shanghai’s French Quarter and Naples’ Quartieri Spagnoli.

Another Australian suburb, North Melbourne, was praised for its “charming village-style vibe” and came in at No 24.

A vibrant culture, a dynamic food scene and lively atmosphere pushed Burwood into the Top 20. The ranking, curated by what Time Out called its “global network of local experts” scores neighbourhoods on their blend of creativity, community, and character.

Burwood stood out for its exceptional diversity, according to Time Out’s editor-in chief in Australia, Alice Ellis, repeating claims made by Burwood council earlier this year that it was the “fifth-most multicultural suburb in Australia”.

Burwood’s mayor, John Faker, said the listing came as “no surprise to us”.

“We’re incredibly proud to be named the 16th coolest neighbourhood in the world and the No 1 in Australia for 2025,” he said.

“Burwood is Sydney’s cultural playground, a place to eat, play, live, and celebrate the rich cultural offerings of our diverse and vibrant community.”

According to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data gathered in the last census, 58% of Burwood residents were born overseas – and almost a third had Chinese ancestry.

Bustling night markets, lunar new year festivities and the neighbourhood’s culinary offerings – not just Chinese, but Japanese, south-east Asian, Uyghur, Greek and Italian – received special mention, as did its recently conferred status by the NSW government as a Special Entertainment Precinct, livening up the suburb’s nightlife with relaxed trading and noise rules.

The neighbourhood was also praised for its “tranquil charm”, especially in Burwood park, but Appian Way, one of Sydney’s most beautiful and significant heritage streets, wasn’t mentioned.

"Less than 1% of population responsible for 40% of all offending in Victoria as crime rate climbs Less than 1% of the Victorian population is responsible for almost half of all offending in the state, police say, as the crime rate continues to climb.

The Crime Statistics Agency (CSA) on Thursday released data showing 638,640 criminal offences were recorded in Victoria in the 2024-25 financial year – an increase of 86,587 offences or 15.7%. When adjusted for population, the crime rate per 100,000 people was 8,998.9, marking a 13.8% rise year-on-year.

The number of criminal incidents also increased by 18.3% to 483,583. The CSA said this represented the highest recorded figures since reporting began in 2004-05.

The increase in the crime rate is marginally smaller than that recorded in the previous quarter but Victoria police’s deputy commissioner for regional operations, Bob Hill, said it was still unacceptably high.

Sign up: AU Breaking News email

He said a cohort of repeat offenders continued to be responsible for a large proportion of total crime recorded in Victoria.

“In terms of our repeat offenders, 5,400 have been charged 10 times or more in the reporting period, responsible for 40% of our crime,” Hill said.

Victoria’s estimated 2024 population, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics was 6.9 million, meaning repeat offenders represent 0.078% of the state.

Hill said the group included 1,128 children, who had been arrested a combined 7,118 times. But, in all, there were 147 fewer young offenders over the reporting period.

Hill announced police had set an “ambitious” target to reduce serious and violent crime by 5% each year and were working on a new plan to deter crime to be released by the chief commissioner of police, Mike Bush, in mid-October.

Bush joined the Victoria police in June after serving as New Zealand’s chief commissioner, where he was credited with creating a crime prevention model that reduced offending in the country by 20% between 2010 and 2014.

No ‘quick fix’

Theft continues to be the fastest growing and most common crime in Victoria. This was primarily driven by theft from cars, with 86,351 offences recorded – a rise of 24,409 offences, or 39.4% on the previous year.

Number plates were the most commonly stolen item, making up almost 40% of all thefts from vehicles, with 32,481 offences – an increase of 10,750 or 49.5%.

Motor vehicle theft also surged, reaching 33,018 offences – an increase of 9,786, or 42.1% – marking the highest level since 2002.

Theft from retail stores continues to rise persistently, with 41,667 offences recorded – an increase of 9,004, or 27.6%.

The fifth-highest crime was family violence, with incidents reaching a record high of 106,427 – an increase of 7,617 or 7.7%.

Hill said a “perfect storm” of circumstances led to the increase, including cost of living pressures, technological developments and organised crime.

He also pointed to Covid-19 exacerbating mental health challenges, a “sensational desire for illicit drugs” and “disconnection” from community, particularly by young people.

The police minister, Anthony Carbines, said there was no “quick fix” to improve the crime rate but but that the state’s controversial “tough” new bail laws were already having a noticeable impact on the data.

The laws came into effect on 28 March and require courts to treat children accused of serious crimes similarly to adults when determining whether to grant bail or keep them in custody. It also makes community safety the “overarching principle” when deciding bail for children and adults.

“Those who’ve lost their bail privileges [is] up 26% for young people, up 46% for adults compared to this time last year,” Carbines said.

He said the second tranche of reforms, which introduces a new “high harm” bail test for repeat offenders and a “two-strike” rule for individuals already on bail who commit further offences, have not yet come into effect.

Opposition leader Brad Battin described the latest statistics as a “complete failure” by the Allan government to tackle crime.

“Every single time we see these crime stats, we see more records, and they’re not the records that anyone wants to break,” he said.",Less than 1% of population responsible for 40% of all offending in Victoria as crime rate climbs,sports,Benita Kolovos,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/25/victoria-crime-rate-increase-up-theft-family-violence,2025-09-25 00:00:00,"In Victoria, less than 1% of the population is responsible for nearly 40% of all recorded crimes, as the state experiences a significant rise in criminal offenses.

"Brisbane kindergarten forced to back down after proposing to charge parents $2,200 for their own children’s art A Brisbane kindergarten has been forced to back down after asking parents to pay $2,200 for their own children’s artwork amid a dispute over the management of the childcare centre.

Craigslea community kindergarten, a local childcare centre in Chermside West in Brisbane’s north, made national headlines this week after a series of emails to parents. The centre has been in turmoil for weeks and was closed after a mass exodus of staff before the school holidays.

On Sunday, the management committee sent parents a 1,000-word email claiming the centre was “insolvent”, owing more than $40,314 to the tax office and employees. It proposed to “wind up” the centre, which has been placed into voluntary administration.

The next day, in a second email the management committee proposed to charge $2,200 for a scrapbook of artwork produced by their children and photographs of them to help pay off the debt.

“If you are opposed to the committee using the portfolios as a $2,200 per piece fundraiser to make up for the $40,314 owing to teachers, please complete the below,” it read.

“Where there are members that have used the separated parents provision for membership, both need to send it in and jointly accept the postage charge in equal parts.”

A spokesperson for the state’s Department of Education said the children’s portfolios “are now available for families to collect, free of charge”.

“Under the education and care services national regulations, parents can request certain documentation pertaining to their child. The approved provider must make the documentation available on request,” the spokesperson said.

According to its website, Craigslea is an “affiliated centre” of C&K Childcare and Kindergarten and receives support from their nationwide firm, but operates as an independent incorporated association managed by a volunteer management committee.

Last year’s audited finances for the centre show it made a $45,003 loss in 2024, with a total income of $360,772.

"Trump hangs autopen photo instead of Biden portrait in new presidential gallery President Donald Trump has added a “Presidential Walk of Fame” to the exterior of the White House, featuring portraits of each of the previous commanders-in-chief – except for one.

Instead of a headshot of Joe Biden, the Republican incumbent instead placed a photo of an autopen signing the Democrat’s name – a reference to Trump’s frequent allegation that the former president was addled by the end of his term in office and not really the one making decisions.

The snub is the latest attempt by Trump to delegitimise a predecessor he routinely belittles, including in front of more than 100 world leaders on Tuesday at the UN general assembly gathering. Trump has never acknowledged his own defeat to Biden in the 2020 election, instead falsely chalking up the outcome to voter fraud.

Trump had previously signalled he would represent Biden with an autopen on the walkway. Trump has alleged without evidence that Biden administration officials may have forged their boss’s signature by using the autopen and taken broad actions he was not aware of.

He has also cast doubt on the validity of pardons and other documents that Biden signed with an autopen, even though other presidents before him have also relied on the device to sign key papers. A Republican-led House committee is investigating the Biden administration’s autopen use.

White House staff sent out a burst of social media posts on Wednesday afternoon gleefully promoting the finished project. The media may get its first in-person glimpse of the display when Trump hosts a dinner on Wednesday night on the new Rose Garden patio that sits adjacent to the West Wing Colonnade on which the portraits hang.

The addition is the latest in a series of design changes he has made at the White House since resuming office. The president also added gold flourishes to the Oval Office walls, installed massive new flagpoles on both lawns, replaced the grass in the Rose Garden with patio stone and started construction on a large new ballroom.",Trump hangs autopen photo instead of Biden portrait in new presidential gallery,sports,N/A,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/25/trump-hangs-autopen-photo-instead-of-biden-portrait-in-new-presidential-gallery,2025-09-25 00:00:00,"President Donald Trump has installed a ""Presidential Walk of Fame"" at the White House, featuring portraits of past presidents but notably replacing Joe Biden's portrait with a photo of an autopen signing his name.

"The Democratic superlawyer Trump can’t silence: ‘We are in the break-glass moment of American history’ Marc Elias, a prominent Democratic election attorney, has not shied away from standing up to the Trump administration, and has been targeted for retribution this year multiple times as a result.

He’s one of scores of lawyers the Trump administration has named in executive actions, joining a list that includes big law firms and attorneys who worked for people Donald Trump considers his opponents.

There’s no shortage of reasons why the president would hate Elias and want to shut him down: Elias has for decades represented high-profile Democrats, including the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, and prominent liberal groups, including the Democratic national committee (DNC). He hired the research group that investigated Trump’s ties to Russia in 2016, eventually becoming the Steele dossier. He specializes in election law and won 64 of the 65 cases he worked on in response to Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.

In one presidential memo, the Trump administration listed “examples of grossly unethical misconduct” by lawyers, singling out Elias for his involvement in the Steele dossier. The law firm Elias used to work for, Perkins Coie, got its own presidential action that cited the dossier. Trump mentioned Elias by name in March at a Department of Justice press conference, calling him a “radical” who was trying to “turn America into a corrupt, communist and third-world country”.

While a long list of big-name law firms have capitulated to Trump’s demands, Elias says his firm was built to withstand the pressure and its important to him to use his platform to fight back, though his outspokenness often comes with pushback.

The presidential memo, which names Elias as an example of an attorney to target, directed the attorney general to “take all appropriate action to refer for disciplinary action” any attorney that violated ethical guidelines and to “review conduct by attorneys or their law firms in litigation against the Federal Government over the last 8 years”.

Elias isn’t aware he’s under investigation, but said he thinks people not taking Trump literally is “one of the great failings” of his time in power.

“Every day we wake up and we see another vindictive act by this administration against its political opponents, whether they be in elective office or be in the private sector,” he said. “I think anyone who uses their voice to speak up against Donald Trump needs to be realistic about the nature of this administration and the threats it poses.”

He didn’t escape scrutiny during Trump’s first term. He first came up on Trump’s radar, to his knowledge, when the president called him the Democrats’ “best Election stealing lawyer” after Elias went to work on a close Senate election in Florida in 2018.

Trump’s second term, though, is like “day and night” from his first, Elias said. The president is now “single-mindedly focused on going after his political opponents” and any walls between Trump and the Department of Justice have crumbled.

“It’s a very different thing when he is not just unleashing the hordes of hate on social media, not just activating the rightwing echo chamber, but is talking to people who are in positions of power to actually do something about his obsessions,” Elias said.

Anyone who tells you that Donald Trump targets them and they don’t care, I think they’re just lying to you Marc Elias

Despite not posting on X anymore – his decision to stop using the platform prompted conspiracy theories from the right – he is far from quiet about his work and his opinions on the Trump administration. He posts often on other platforms, runs a democracy-focused outlet and files lawsuits against the Trump administration on the regular.

“Every day we wake up and we see another vindictive act by this administration against its political opponents, whether they be in elective office or be in the private sector,” he said. “I think anyone who uses their voice to speak up against Donald Trump needs to be realistic about the nature of this administration and the threats it poses.”

In response to questions about why the administration has targeted Elias, Davis Ingle, a spokesman for the White House, said Elias “is a crooked hack who was deeply involved in creating a false ‘dossier’ against President Trump on behalf of his crooked client Hillary Clinton, in order to sway the 2016 election in her favor. Marc Elias is a disgraceful swamp creature and President Trump is draining that swamp.”

Elias, Democratic superlawyer

A lifelong Democrat, Elias helped build up election law to what it is today. When he was a young lawyer, it was a rare specialty – election disputes were typically seen as political issues, not legal ones. Now, post-election disputes are almost entirely legal issues.

A 2008 Senate race in Minnesota in which Democrat Al Franken eventually won over Republican Norm Coleman turned the tide. Elias served as Franken’s counsel in what became the longest recount in US history. At the time, some in his party said Franken should concede since Democrats had a strong majority in the Senate and Barack Obama had just won the White House. Elias is always on “team fight”, he said, because “as long as there is a legal fight to be had, we are going to have it”.

Some have opined that his fighting posture can be counterproductive to voting rights, especially with the courts growing more conservative, because the cases can create bad precedent. He has argued for increased coordination between outside political action committees and political parties, a move that Trump capitalized on for his ground game in 2024. In 2023, Joe Biden parted ways with Elias, with sources saying at the time that Biden’s team had frustrations and discomfort with Elias’s hard charging and big legal bills. That year, he also stopped representing the DNC.

“There was a time where there were people who would say: ‘Marc is too quick to litigate, and you can make bad law.’ And I would say then, and I would certainly say now, what are you saving these laws for, if it is not for this moment? … We are in the break-glass moment of American history when it comes to free and fair elections and democracy and so, no, I don’t have any hesitation about litigating everything that we possibly can to protect elections.”

He worked at Perkins Coie until 2021, heading up its political law work and counting a host of big-name Democratic groups and elected officials as his clients. He started his own firm, Elias Law Group, after that, and Democracy Docket, which documents attacks on democracy.

The firm is built to “withstand the pressures of Donald Trump” and only takes on clients from Democratic campaigns, the party itself, clients associated with Democratic politics or groups advancing voting rights on a nonpartisan basis. It does not take on corporate clients or clients with government contracts. That stance is part of why Elias thinks his firm itself hasn’t been targeted in a Trump executive action. There are fewer ways to pressure him.

Elias was initially surprised at the executive orders targeting law firms because he thought the firms would fight back and win, and Trump would look foolish in the process. He didn’t count on the “cowardice” of firms that instead struck up settlements with Trump, capitulating to the president’s demands by dropping cases and giving massive amounts of pro bono work to conservative causes. The firms that did fight back, including Perkins Coie, have won, but it’s hard to argue Trump didn’t achieve his goals by going after lawyers, he said.

“I think he thought, if I can prevent big law from being that role, that’ll make it easier for me to run roughshod over people’s rights. And he’s not wrong about that,” Elias said. “He has actually intimidated a lot of law firms, I think, from taking on causes that they otherwise would have taken on.”

When CBS’s 60 Minutes covered the crackdown on lawyers in May, host Scott Pelley noted that “it was nearly impossible to get anyone on camera for this story because of the fear now running through our system of justice”. Elias sat for an interview.

Elias has grappled with whether and how to speak up. Over the years, he’s had threats against him and has at times needed to take extra security precautions. He receives a host of antisemitic commentary, including a writeup years ago in a neo-Nazi publication. He’s often listed as part of the “deep state” despite never working in the government, and called a “globalist”, a frequent antisemitic dog whistle, which he typically dismisses as trolling.

He worries about his family. He worries about the people who work at his law firm every day, and about his clients, who have at times received blowback for their association with him.

“Anyone who tells you that Donald Trump targets them and they don’t care, I think they’re just lying to you,” he said. “I think anyone who says they’re not afraid is either a psychopath or a liar. Of course you’re afraid. Literally the president of the United States, who ran for election on a campaign of vengeance and revenge, is talking about you. Of course you’re worried.”",The Democratic superlawyer Trump can’t silence: ‘We are in the break-glass moment of American history’,sports,Rachel Leingang,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/24/marc-elias-trump-democrats-retribution,2025-09-24 00:00:00,"Marc Elias, a prominent Democratic election attorney, has faced multiple attacks from the Trump administration due to his legal work against Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.

"House of Guinness review – James Norton’s pheromones positively sizzle off the screen You may judge a show’s success by the number of imitators that follow: to see how much TV commissioners envied the popularity of Slow Horses, look at the recent uptick in wry dramas about spies and/or shambling outcasts who work in a grotty basement but get the job done. Another show with that status is Peaky Blinders, writer Steven Knight’s swaggering epic about a (real) Birmingham crime gang between the wars.

What’s unusual about the post-Blinders shows is that the author of the towering original has tended to write the pretenders to the throne himself: Knight sought to develop the formula earlier this year with A Thousand Blows, a series about a different historical crime gang, and with his new Netflix show House of Guinness, he seems to be mining the same seam. The family here is not a crime family: we are in Dublin in 1868, where Guinness is so ubiquitous that the unimaginably wealthy Guinness family run the city. But managing the factory that dominates the landscape is the fearsome Sean Rafferty (James Norton), an arch schemer whose currency is violence. He introduces himself by issuing a rallying call to the company workers, exhorting them to crush an anti-Guinness street protest then leading the way himself, gleefully swinging a hunk of hard factory iron.

Later on in episode one, when the Guinness cooperage is torched by malcontents, Rafferty walks into the blaze, impervious in a swishing long coat and with a clattering 21st-century rock soundtrack behind him, to sort it out. He is the steaming punk in a world where corruption outstrips the rule of law, where punches land with a merciless crunch, where chains clank, hessian chafes and pressure gauges are forever twitching into the red. The domineering patriarch of the Guinness dynasty, Benjamin, has just died, and none of his four adult children seem equipped to take over. This could be Rafferty’s moment.

Watch more than one episode of House of Guinness, however, and a realisation soon arrives: Rafferty may be an unstoppable force, but our focus slowly centres on the Guinness kids. This isn’t Peaky Blinders, the Irish prequel. It’s 19th-century Dublin’s answer to Succession. The big fella has died before it starts, but we still have three sons and a daughter whose lives have been ruined by the extreme blessings Dad’s evil genius has given them. As in Succession, or The Crown at its best, the show is alive to the fact that tragedy plus privilege still equals tragedy; it makes us feel the pain of the pampered, or at least be fascinated by it, even if we’re a step removed from it.

And what characters the Guinness quartet are, confidently drawn and wisely performed, powering a fine drama about people with flaws they can’t overcome, delusions of qualities they don’t possess, and weaknesses their foes will inevitably exploit. Arthur (Anthony Boyle) seems selfish enough to realise his dream of adding political power to his inherited financial might, but his superiority complex has made him impetuous and too quick to anger, and he is cursed by the times into which he has been born: his homosexuality is an open secret that could destroy him at any minute. A better bet for the business, then, might be little bro Edward (Louis Partridge), but his pragmatism masks an idealism that might not survive contact with the cold realities of commercialism.

Observing the filial power struggle is sister Anne, who is woefully overlooked by the family and slightly underserved by the drama, but who still provides House of Guinness with additional smarts and heart, thanks to a terrific turn by Emily Fairn, following up an unforgettable debut as lost soul Casey in The Responder. Then there is Benjamin Jr (Fionn O’Shea), who has succumbed to gambling and booze when we meet him – the only brother who has stopped pretending to be something he is not.

As the shouting, fighting and drawing-room tensions escalate, and as sex proves to be as much of a hindrance to clear thinking as money (the casting of Norton, pheromones fairly radiating from the screen, is a big help there), House of Guinness matures into a romp that you can hardly resist, especially when it makes such good use of its time and place. We are less than two decades on from the potato famine, and Ireland’s yearning for freedom is reaching breaking point: both are woven sensitively into the saga, making it an even richer study of the toxic rich – and making House of Guinness, for Steven Knight, a career peak.",House of Guinness review – James Norton’s pheromones positively sizzle off the screen,sports,Jack Seale,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/25/house-of-guinness-review-james-norton-pheromones-positively-sizzle-off-the-screen,2025-09-25 00:00:00,"Steven Knight's new Netflix series, House of Guinness, explores the power dynamics within the wealthy Guinness family in 19th-century Dublin, focusing on the scheming Sean Rafferty and the family's flawed children as they navigate their father's death and the ensuing chaos.

With a backdrop of historical events and societal tensions, House of Guinness offers a rich narrative about the toxic nature of wealth and familial legacy.",1,0,1
"DNA tests to determine if heart belongs to Australian man who died in Bali DNA testing is being carried out on a heart that is claimed to be that of Queensland man Byron Haddow, who died in Bali in May.

Haddow, 23, was found dead in the plunge pool of his villa while on holiday. His body was returned to Australia four weeks later and a second autopsy found his heart was missing.

The family’s legal representative in Bali, Ni Luh Arie Ratna Sukasari, told Guardian Australia there was a “possibility” the heart that was then returned – two months after Haddow’s death – was not his.

“This possibility is under examination. The returned heart is undergoing DNA testing in Queensland to verify that it is indeed Byron’s. The family insists on certainty, full transparency, and dignity for their son,” she said on Thursday afternoon.

The Bali hospital that carried out the autopsy has denied allegations it was involved in organ theft after Australian officials demanded answers from their Indonesian counterparts.

I Made Darmajaya, director of medical nursing and support at Prof Ngoerah hospital, denied the hospital was involved in organ theft, explaining that the hospital carried out a forensic autopsy on Haddow’s body after a request from local police.

“I emphasise, on behalf of Prof Ngoerah hospital, that the circulating rumours of organ theft are false,” he told reporters.

“There is no interest of the hospital to withhold [the heart]. Actually, our interest was in the context of examination in accordance with the law.”

He said Haddow’s heart was repatriated to Australia after the rest of his body as it took a long time to process it to meet the requirements for a pathological examination.

But Ni Luh Arie Ratna Sukasari said a further autopsy on the heart in Bali was carried out without the family’s knowledge or consent and that the hospital had not issued a proper explanation.

“Instead, they proceeded to arrange the organ’s return and even demanded the family pay an additional A$700 for the repatriation,” she said.

She and the family are demanding an independent police investigation into Haddow’s death and for Prof Ngoerah hospital to provide clarification about the procedures carried out on his body, “especially regarding the removal and retention of Byron’s heart without family consent”.

She said Haddow’s parents, Robert and Chantal, were “devastated – not only by the loss of their son but also by the way his body and organs were handled”.

“They have described the treatment of Byron after death as inhumane, compounding their grief. Still, they remain determined to pursue justice until the truth is fully uncovered,” she said.

Byron’s mother, Chantal Haddow, told Guardian Australia she had “so many questions” but could not comment further.

A spokesperson for Australia’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday they were providing consular assistance to Haddow’s family but could not provide further comment, citing privacy obligations.

On Wednesday, Ni Luh Arie Ratna Sukasari said Haddow’s heart was returned to Queensland in August, and that the the incident raised “serious questions” about medical practices in Bali.",DNA tests to determine if heart belongs to Australian man who died in Bali,sports,Daisy Dumas,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/byron-haddow-australian-man-bali-hospital-denies-organ-theft-allegations,2025-09-25 00:00:00,"DNA testing is underway to confirm whether a heart returned to the family of Byron Haddow, an Australian man who died in Bali, actually belongs to him, as his family raises concerns about the handling of his body after his death.

"Wayward review – Toni Collette is utterly magnificent in this eerie thriller about teen runaways Oh happy day, when we were divided from America, as that insightful old veggie burger George Bernard Shaw had it, only by a common language. These days, there’s rather a lot more to contend with. One that may still be swimming under your radar – or perhaps just obscured by the massive orange flares going off every 30 seconds – is the multibillion dollar “troubled teen industry”. From sea to shining sea, the US is filled with privately run “therapeutic” institutions that promise to rehabilitate “difficult” teenagers and turn them into civilised members of society. They are often transported there by “teen escort services”, who come for the unsuspecting adolescents in the middle of the night and remove them against their – though not their parents’ – will from the family home. “But that’s tantamount to kidnap!” you may think, in your silly British way. And that is why they fought to become independent of us and our lily-livers all those years ago.

That is the background against which Mae Martin, standup comedian and writer of the immaculate comedy, Feel Good, has created the eight part mystery drama Wayward. (Martin is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns. Their character in Wayward, a cop called Alex Dempsey, is a trans man. Martin’s mesmeric presence, comic timing and occasional air of possession by a baffled duckling endure).

View image in fullscreen Has the air of being possessed by a baffled duckling … Mae Martin as Alex Dempsey in Wayward. Photograph: Michael Gibson/Netflix

Wayward is set in 2003 – partly, I suspect, to avoid the many problems the setup would face if these teens had access to smartphones, and partly to add to the excellently eerie vibe. There is nothing stranger than the recent past. Alex and his pregnant wife, Laura (Sarah Gadon), move to Tall Pines, Vermont – the latter’s bucolic home town – for a fresh start, after the former was involved in a bad shooting on the job. I don’t know how often it works out in real life for Americans who return to their bucolic home towns for a fresh start, but in television the percentage must be in the low single figures. So it proves for our sweet young couple.

The town is host to the Tall Pines Academy, a centre run by the deeply odd, bordering on sinister, Evelyn Wade, utterly magnificently played by Toni Collette, who manages to combine terrifying understatement with a Grand Guignol air that is absolutely compelling. She gives a coherence to the whole show that the writing does not entirely earn. But to believe in Evelyn is to believe in everything, and you have to believe in Evelyn. It’s like your resistance has been kidnapped.

When Alex becomes involved with the fate of a runaway from the academy, his investigations into the boy, as well as the townsfolk’s unquestioning acceptance of the academy’s power, fuel darker and darker suspicions. Theses suspicions are compounded by the discovery that Laura was once a pupil/inmate at the academy and that Evelyn seems to still exert an unwholesome amount of influence over her.

A concurrent plotline follows two teenage best friends from Toronto – the bereaved, drug-dabbling Leila (Alyvia Alyn Lind) and the more stable Abbie (Sydney Topliffe), whose main form of rebellion seems to be being friends with Leila. It is enough for her strict parents to have her kidnapped/taken away to the academy. Leila mounts a rescue attempt and is duly incarcerated there too. The place is full of cultish argot, rituals and group counselling classes that resemble struggle sessions more than any kind of healing practice. Physical and psychological abuse is overt and hints of sexual abuse are everywhere. The hold Evelyn has over her charges – and the staff, all recruited from earlier student cohorts – borders on the unholy. Though, ultimately, Wayward is asking us to consider the power of malevolent manipulation on vulnerable people rather than seeking to delve into the occult.

Wayward is stylish and hugely watchable – it’s hard for one’s inner adolescent to look away from a punchy eight-parter where so many comeuppances are delivered to horrible grownups. But it tries to do so many things that it doesn’t quite succeed in any. You can feel it trying to interrogate the troubled teen industry, the parents that use it and the profiteers that run it. It also tries to explore the nature of modern youth and the new uncharted areas that kids are required to navigate alone. Plus, it’s trying to deliver a satisfying mystery plot, infuse it with the comedy that comes as naturally to Martin as breathing and put in some emotional payoffs to stop the whole thing becoming a cartoon version of Twin Peaks. Less could have been more, but the warmth and intelligence that Martin as an actor and writer (along with others, in the latter case) brings to the endeavour means it cannot help but endear itself to the viewer. Three stars become four, and no regrets.",Wayward review – Toni Collette is utterly magnificent in this eerie thriller about teen runaways,sports,Lucy Mangan,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/25/wayward-review-toni-collette-is-utterly-magnificent-mae-martin-netflix,2025-09-25 00:00:00,"Wayward, a new thriller series created by Mae Martin, delves into the dark world of the troubled teen industry, focusing on a cop's investigation into a sinister academy for adolescents.

"Special relationship? There can be no such thing with a snake like Trump | Aditya Chakrabortty For all the ink shed on the subject of Donald Trump, hardly a word is said about his love of poetry. Yet there is at least one piece of verse he adores and regularly performs to cheering crowds. Last month, the White House even turned it into a short film. Called The Snake (and originally written as a song by Oscar Brown Jr), it is as close as this president gets to a credo.

The poem begins with a half-frozen snake, “all frosted with the dew” and begging to be taken into the warmth. His plea is heeded by a “tender-hearted woman”:

She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk

And she laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk

Stroking and kissing his “pretty skin”, the woman clasps him tight but “instead of saying thank you, the snake gave her a vicious bite”.

These rhymes are the very essence of Trumpism: never let outsiders get too close, or you’ll be repaid in venom. No hugs, just extraction. It’s how he sees business, politics and, naturally, immigration. His recital on the White House video is overlaid with images of brown-skinned men in handcuffs getting hauled away.

Watching his extraordinary speech this week at the UN, I thought again of The Snake. It is the perfect depiction of the dynamic between Trump and the British establishment – a relationship where Trump is the vicious serpent.



Last week he was Keir Starmer’s most honoured guest, enjoying a banquet at Windsor Castle and wooed by King Charles as “the closest of kin”. One return flight later, Trump tore into his host – “I hope the prime minister’s listening” – and lumped the UK among those Old World shitholes “going to hell”.

“You’ve bitten me, but why?

“And you knew your bite was poisonous and now I’m going to die.”

For the best part of a year, Starmer has hugged Trump as close as he can: an unprecedented second state visit, a night at a castle and a day at Chequers, photo ops with royals. All this for yankee dollars. Lower tariffs and higher investment are Starmer’s ROI (Return on Ingratiation). Last week he snagged his biggest prize yet, the US-UK tech deal. “Record-breaking” investment, trumpeted Downing Street. “A wowee number,” agreed the BBC’s estimable business editor Simon Jack. Prepare for it to be ballyhooed at next week’s Labour conference – and for the press pack to nod along. After all, they spent more time last week gawping at Melania’s hats than delving below the topline figures.

Yet if Labour members and other voters knew what had actually been signed in their names they would be angered, rather than heartened. Far closer to the truth is to imagine a snake in skin of stars and stripes, wrapping itself ever tighter around your land, your data, your water supply and your electricity pylons – all the while claiming it’s for your own good.

It’s not just the double-counting of projects unveiled a year or more ago, such as Google’s grand opening by the M25 or Blackstone in Northumberland. Such are the grubby standards of British government.

Far more striking is Starmer’s doffing his cap at foreign investors as “life-changing”. Most Britons will feel differently. The Glazers, Blackstone and Macquarie are all examples of “inward investment”, but fans of Manchester United, patients of Southern Cross care homes and customers of Thames Water could tell MPs how well those went.

So it shall prove with the £31bn of technology investments. Whitehall’s own publications make clear that most of the US cash is not going into new businesses or swanky offices, but datacentres – which are absolutely central to AI, yet barely discussed in British politics. Our government claims they are “the factories powering AI” because in Westminster “factories” is shorthand for production, people, jobs. That is exactly not what datacentres are. They are much closer to hi-tech warehouses full, not of people, but machines. They don’t produce, they store: your data and mine. Nor do they provide much employment.

Look at the planning documents for Blackstone’s new premises outside Blyth in Northumberland: more than 500,000 sq m for up to 10 datacentres. Blackstone estimates that construction will require at peak 1,200 workers for an estimated 10 years.

“Jobs, jobs, jobs,” promised Starmer. Really? Once up and running, the entire vast complex will need only 40 employees for each datacentre. But by then the Labour leader will be long gone.



Ask Blackstone what the permanent staff will do, and it’s admirably upfront: these people will not be generals of the new data economy but its lowly footsolders, on wages to match – the maintenance, support and security guards. This site was meant to be the bustling Britishvolt factory, back when Boris Johnson was at his most boosterish. Now it will be a giant empty Mary Celeste.

Yet the “hyperscale” datacentres going up across Britain are essential to Microsoft, Google and the other US giants who sit atop the artificial intelligence industry and who need vast computing power. It’s Silicon Valley that will own, operate and kit out the centres – and many of the billions that Starmer claims are coming to our shores will flow back west. It’s not the bricks and mortar that requires all those billions – it’s the Nvidia chips that go inside.

These datacentres are the equivalent to “American military bases on British soil”, says Cecilia Rikap, an AI expert at University College London. They are spaces beyond oversight (the government doesn’t even know how many datacentres are on British soil) and their owners will demand low taxes.

“Take me in, oh tender woman

“Take me in, for heaven’s sake

“Take me in, oh tender woman,” sighed that vicious snake

For Silicon Valley, the economy of tomorrow. For the rest of us? In the capital, datacentres are already competing with houses for energy and water. In documents published earlier this year, the borough of Tower Hamlets in east London warned of the risk of a “sudden increase in connection applications from datacentres, reserving available network capacity”. The consequences, officials warned, could be that “housebuilding, at scale, is unable to proceed for potentially 10 years+, due to lack of available electrical capacity”.

The UK risks becoming a “vassal state,” warned Nick Clegg last week and for the first time since 2010, we can all agree with Nick. We are tying ourselves into Silicon Valley’s AI infrastructure: its datacentres, its cloud computing. The plumbing and pipelines of our information economy are owned and run through Trump’s US. As the president flew into Stansted, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, Jon Cunliffe, warned that the US could easily “weaponise” its dominance of the international payments system, flicking a “kill switch” to disable countries for resisting White House diktat. Think Canada, if it doesn’t want to become the 51st state, or Denmark if it insists on keeping Greenland.

And if you still think it impossible that Trump could force huge American companies to bend to his political will, just ask Jimmy Kimmel.

"Australia’s horrifying climate future in four charts – and how we can avoid the worst Australia’s national climate risk assessment report, released last week, revealed a horrifying future if urgent action to address global heating was not taken.

The report looked at 10 “priority hazards” – such as bushfires, flooding and extreme heat – and the risks they presented across Australia’s way of life (you can read about the key takeaways from the report here).

Accompanying the report was a new tool from the Australian Climate Service which provides access to data about climate hazards and risks.

Here, I’ve brought together some of the maps released by the ACS which show just how bad things will get for heatwaves, drought and coastal flooding.

It is important to note that the worst outcomes shown on these graphics can still be avoided if urgent action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The highest levels shown are based on a 3C increase in global temperatures which could happen as early as 2050 if emissions are not curbed.

According to the ACS the number of severe and extreme heatwave days is projected to increase, with the greatest increase in the northern parts of Australia.

As a consequence of the increase in temperatures and heatwaves, heat-related mortality is projected to increase dramatically under the worst global heating scenarios:

Heatwaves are Australia’s deadliest natural hazard, with one recent study estimating they caused as many as 1,009 deaths in Australia from 2016 to 2019. The deaths attributed to heatwaves vary greatly depending on the methods used – the numbers are lower when only considering deaths that list heat as a contributing factor on official documents such as coroner records and death certificates, but far higher when statistical methods are used to estimate excess mortality associated with heatwave events.

Time spent in drought is projected to increase, especially for areas in southern Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia:

This will have obvious consequences for the agricultural industry, with reduced rainfall in growing seasons, in addition to crops facing higher heat stress from increased temperatures.

In coastal areas, the ACS projects a significant increase in coastal flooding as sea levels rise. The following map shows the average number of days each year exceeding the record flood level, which is the highest water level recorded over the baseline period (1995–2014) at each location:

Minor flooding is also projected to increase significantly. For example, Sydney currently experiences minor flooding 31 days per year on average, but this could increase to 344 days a year with 3C of warming.

One headline figure from the climate risk report is that by 2050, more than 1.5 million people would be living in areas around the country that would be hit by rising sea levels and coastal flooding.

All of which underscores the importance of setting meaningful and ambitious targets for reducing emissions.",Australia’s horrifying climate future in four charts – and how we can avoid the worst,sports,Nick Evershed,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/sep/25/australias-horrifying-climate-future-in-four-charts-and-how-we-can-avoid-the-worst,2025-09-25 00:00:00,"Australia's recent climate risk assessment report reveals alarming projections for the country's future, highlighting the potential for increased heatwaves, droughts, and coastal flooding if urgent action on emissions is not taken.

"Loaded fries, tacos and perfect pies: eight crowd-pleasing recipes for footy finals weekend With tickets to the feline showdown of Cats v Lions all sold out, one of the best ways to get in on grand final fever is to invite a few friends over to watch the historic Geelong v Brisbane showdown from the couch. Ahead of first bounce at 2.30pm, prepare a spread of handheld snacks, such as Rachel Roddy’s pizze fritte or air-fryer chicken wings, and you’ve got yourself a spread to defeat any dish from the MCG.

(Pictured above)

Nothing beats crumbing fish yourself, says Alice Zaslavsky. She makes fish fingers from scratch, opting for flathead because “its flesh is firm yet flaky and its flavour sweet and mild”. It’s covered in a Kewpie mayo and panko crumb coating, which is light and crunchy, and she blitzes frozen peas into the guacamole for extra veg protein, vibrant colour and texture. You can sub in supermarket fish fingers – but if you are up for the challenge, the cookbook author says doing it yourself will take just 20 minutes “from fillet to finger”.

It takes a fair bit of effort – and 90 minutes– to make these pies but you’ll be rewarded with a perfect take on a footy classic. Cloake uses mutton or lamb shoulder in her meat and potato pie, but she says any finely chopped beef or alternative meat will do the trick. “Whatever meat you choose, it’s wise to cut the pieces fairly small, so they cook faster in their pastry coffins,” she says. The pastry is the star ingredient. She uses dripping or fats from the meat to give it a proper crust. You’ll need to bake them for 25 minutes, then for another 25-35 minutes at a lower oven temperature until the pastry is deep golden.

Rules? There are no rules when it comes to the chips you use as your base. Any form of crispy potato works, from skinny fries to roast potatoes, says Tony Naylor. If you’re using an oven, we’d recommend potato gems, which won our supermarket hash brown taste test, or for an air fryer, try Birds Eye Golden Crunch thin and crispy chips, which Choice crowned best of the supermarket aisle.

Instead of a recipe, Naylor gives a list of possibilities for loading them. He asked experts to share their wisdom on loaded fries. “Think about balance – for example, offset soft pulled meats with something crunchy or dry,” says Zoë Perrett, co-owner of UK burger brand Slap & Pickle. “Go crazy with what you have in the fridge,” says Meriel Armitage, chef-owner at Club Mexican in London, who likes grilling vegan cheese over fries and adding a plant-based chilli, tomato salsa and chilli lime salt.

You don’t need to make dips from scratch, says Ramael Scully. Even a squeeze of fresh lemon and a little extra seasoning will transform mundane supermarket dips. In this low-effort recipe, the Malaysian Australian chef uses yuzu juice and yuzu kosho to pep up a traditional guacamole dip. The yuzu juice adds a sweet/sour element, “While the kosho, which is a bit like a citrus wasabi, has a fiery kick that brings the dip alive,” he says. Stir two teaspoons of each into a pot of guacamole and then it’s done.

One of the most satisfying sights in the kitchen is watching a circle of yeasted dough in very hot oil, says Rachel Roddy. Frying dough is one of the food writer’s favourite smells. Her little fried pizzas only take a commercial break-friendly minute on each side to puff up and turn golden. Once she has fried the plum-sized pieces of dough she tops each pizzette with a blob of tomato sauce, grated parmesan or pecorino and a basil leaf, and serves immediately.

These mac ’n’ cheese canapés are as easy to make for 50 people as they are for six. “They’re substantial, don’t give people mucky fingers or stain their new white shirt, and they’re great for kids, too,” says Georgia Levy. She likes to serve them warm or at room temperature with some frazzled spring onions spooned over. You will only need to bake the canapés for 15 to 20 minutes in the oven until they are golden on top, then let them cool for 10 minutes to help them hold together.

Fritters are perfect for a crowd because you can make them ahead and warm them through just before serving as a bite-size snack, says Rukmini Iyer. They’re also a great way to get kids to eat vegetables. Grated zucchini and grated halloumi are mixed with mashed chickpeas, flour and egg to make a thick batter. She makes the mayonnaise, yoghurt, lemon and dill dip while the fritters are frying. You can prepare these ahead, then cover and refrigerate until you’re ready to reheat them in the oven, which takes just five minutes.

"Moving to an island of 300 people, it took effort to become a local. But that hard work paid off “You’ll lose your friends,” said one of those friends when I moved to Dangar Island. As a migrant, with only two daughters and husband nearby, I was looking for community.

Accessed by boat, a little over 300 people live on Dangar Island, on the northern outskirts of Sydney on the Hawkesbury River.

I’d visited the island many times – we shared a weekender there with friends. But when the girls left home and my husband retired, we moved to Dangar permanently. We didn’t go blindly. Armed with our boat licences, we understood some of the trials of living on an island. We knew a few people by name and others by sight.

I quickly learned that it takes time and effort to become part of a community. It takes even longer to become accepted as a local.

I set to work. I volunteered for the Hall Committee, taking on the unenviable role of secretary. I invited people to dinner. I invited them again. To meet people, I regularly went to what was then a community-run cafe for coffee. Over one such coffee, Michael, who is now a dear friend, cajoled me into participating in an art show to raise funds for the cafe.

View image in fullscreen The author’s husband, Bronek Karcz, and grandchildren, admire the author’s Scrabble artwork. Photograph: Joanne Karcz

I’m no artist. But the theme, Flotsam and Jetsam, spoke to me. Feeling safe and supported, I was happy to put myself out there with a small work. On our little beach I uncovered broken bits of crockery – triangles of hospital green, pieces from saucer edges patterned in blue and white and cream bits embossed with little flowers. I glued these relics into a shadow box. Surprisingly, it sold – for a reasonable price.

That art show was the start of a creative journey. When Michael suggested that Dangar have its own sculpture walk, I didn’t need persuading. Years later, my 14 oversized scrabble tiles that spell “DANGAR ISLAND” plus two other random letters, continue to entertain.

View image in fullscreen Locals play with the sculpture created by the author. Composite: Guardian Design/Joanne Karcz

When I pass the “Scrabble” on my morning walk, I often read words pertinent to current affairs or the natural beauty of Dangar. As I stroll, I talk to the birds. Magpies, instead of dive-bombing, warble and greet me back. Kookaburras laugh and tiny white-browed scrubwrens chatter as they flit between branches in the undergrowth.

The squawking and screeching of sulphur-crested cockatoos in our huge, 150-year-old blackbutt eucalyptus once frightened a guest from the city. I looked up to see the birds furiously flapping their wings while attacking a goanna climbing towards their nest. Other times it has been a terrified ring-tailed possum scurrying along ever smaller branches, trying to escape the birds’ onslaught.

Walking to the cafe one day, I met two young children that I only knew by sight. I chatted to them and discovered they’d been harvesting soft clay on the side of the road. Resting in their outstretched palms were a hand-fashioned bowl and an animal which they were taking home to bake in their mother’s oven.

That the siblings could roam around the car-free island unsupervised sent me on another creative journey. I wrote about the island from a child’s perspective in my first children’s picture book.

Over the years, I’ve participated in a pantomime, dressed up for Dangardigras pride parades and joined more than 40 people in a progressive dinner. Sometime in November, people will start asking me about our street party which we’ve held every year for more than 10 years, apart from a break during Covid-19 lockdowns. Everyone looks forward to my sausage rolls.

These days, as I write at my desk looking out across the river, I’ll stop for a minute to watch the ferry chug past. When I hear the familiar commentary from the Riverboat Postman, I’ll know it’s a few minutes past 10am. Time for tea.

In the evening, my husband and I occasionally sit down at the boat shed to enjoy the last warm rays of the setting sun. When we hear our neighbours speeding home across the water, I catch my husband’s eye. In unspoken agreement we walk to the end of our jetty and wave the neighbours in to join us for a drink.

Dangar Island enriches my life. And I still regularly catch up with off-island friends. I didn’t lose them after all, and I gained much more than the community I sought.","Moving to an island of 300 people, it took effort to become a local.

"Australian supermarket ground coffee taste test: we tried 41 varieties, two ways A few weeks ago my mum called me three times in one day, not for our usual chat but for an update on my health. I had told her, some days earlier, I was going to do a coffee taste test for work.

“How many will you be trying?”

“Forty-one … actually 82, because we have to try each one black and with milk.”

“Nicholas – 82? You can’t be serious. Will you be OK? Why do you have to try that many?”

“Will I be OK? Who knows. But you can’t say something is the best unless you’ve tried all the options.’’

Maybe she was worried I would pass out, go into cardiac arrest or reach a point of such enlightenment I no longer needed a mortal vessel. Frankly, I was worried about the same thing. When I tasted 11 instant coffees, I spent the following afternoon feeling as though my brain had turned into a hurricane, and every little piece of flying debris was either an idea or moment of panic – I’d experience the first nanosecond of each before 10,000 more flew past.

This was 41 different coffees, done two ways. I’ve never been more anxious and stressed about a taste test, or any piece of work I’ve had to do, ever. But, I remind myself, I’m a food writer not an ICU nurse – my duty is not saving lives, it’s eating and drinking.

Getting obscenely high is the least I can do for my compatriots.

View image in fullscreen Condesa Co.Lab in Sydney hosted the ‘cupping’, which took almost three hours. Photograph: Rémi Chauvin/The Guardian

I identified 21 supermarket coffee providers with nationally available, pre-ground bags of coffee and I acquired the varying brands and roasts from each. (A whole bean taste test is another level of complex; but note: if you can grind coffee evenly and reliably at home, whole beans generally produce tastier coffee than pre-ground).

Condesa Co.Lab, a coffee importer and consultancy, helped me run the taste test as a cupping (an industry-standard way to judge coffee) at their Sydney lab. Each sample was brewed twice, with milk added to one. All were presented to the reviewers blind. Along with two Condesa representatives, Claire Liu and Keelan Brown, Rowena Chansiri (Ickle Coffee) and Matt Uramoto (Onta Coffee) joined as reviewers. We tasted the coffees over four rounds: medium roasts, medium-dark roasts, dark roasts and organic coffees. We scored each coffee for bitterness, acidity, sweetness, aroma, flavour and flavour with milk. The final score is a combination of aroma and flavour. The taste test took two-and-a-half hours.

View image in fullscreen Each coffee was scored on bitterness, acidity, sweetness, aroma, flavour and flavour with milk. Photograph: Rémi Chauvin/The Guardian

I can’t remember when I next spoke to my mum. I think it was the day after. But I remember her asking, with considerable panic in her voice: “Are you OK?”

“Not really,” I said. I don’t think I was OK for the next four days, but I had found some winners, way more losers, and a few other interesting results.

This taste test is a little different from usual, and because of the sheer number of products and the fact that coffee is notoriously personal (even if they don’t know quite what it is, everyone has their preferred roast profile, brewing methods, milk ratios and flavour profile), I do not recommend defaulting to the winner we’ve chosen. Price, branding and best-before dates aren’t useful general indicators either – neither correlated with good scores. Instead, you’ll need to investigate your own tastes and pick the coffee that’s right for you. To help, we’ve put together a graph and some pointers.

Milk no sugar

If you enjoy the coffee of Italian servos and Parisian cafes that haven’t changed since the typewriter age, then sort by bitterness and score then pick whatever is in the furthest corner or, for the skim readers, search the shelves for Lazzio Dark, Daley St Medium Roast, Vittoria Coffee Mountain Grown, Campos Colombia and Sacred Grounds Groover Blend. If you want something a little smoother, Lazzio Medium, Lazzio Organic, Melitta Blue Mountain Style and Byron Bay Coffee Company Nero Espresso are less bitter options that have enough heft to carry a milk coffee. Those who want a lighter and fruitier experience, if a little unusual, go for Oxfam Australia Fair Ethiopia or Jasper Coffee Ethiopia Yirgacheffe.

Milk with sugar

If you have enough milk and sugar, you can make a tasty cuppa with almost any of these products (see below for what to avoid). Just sort by score and intensity, and pick whatever matches your inclinations.

View image in fullscreen Everyone has their preferred roast profile, brewing methods, milk ratios and flavour profile. Photograph: Rémi Chauvin/The Guardian

Black no sugar

If you’re looking for nuance, the options are slim. There are very few coffees with noticeable acidity, sweetness or origin characteristics – most of that is lost in darker roasts, replaced by bitterness and a more generic roasted coffee flavour. The three options that stand out are Jasper Coffee Ethiopia Yirgacheffe, Oxfam Australia Fair Ethiopia and Sacred Grounds Olá Brazil. If you care less about nuance and more about having a generally punchy coffee experience try Melitta Blue Mountain Style, Lazzio Medium and Grinders Coffee Roasters Rich Espresso.

Black with sugar

The products mentioned in the above paragraph all work with added sweetness, but there’s also a pool of coffees that work with sugar but not without because they’re either too bitter, boring, earthy or vegetal. A bit of sugar or honey and you’ll make a great drink out of the Sacred Grounds Groover Blend, any of the coffees in the Grinders or Campos range and, for a budget option, Coles Urban Coffee Culture Strong, which was oddly sweeter and less burnt-tasting than the medium roast of the same brand.

The best overall

Jasper Coffee Ethiopia Yirgacheffe, 250g, $19.49 ($7.80 per 100g), available at select grocers

Score with milk: 6.5/10

Score black: 8/10

After trying more than 30 coffees, many of which tasted as though they’d been brewed in mulch, an ashtray or hell, I started to have doubts – is coffee for me? Is it for anyone? Have the last two hours been karmic punishment for something I’ve done – mean-spirited high school pranks, a reversal of the privilege I received at birth, or some deed I don’t even remember? Drinking this instantly dispelled my spiral. It was a reminder of what coffee can be: complex, bright and evocative of flavours not usually associated with coffee – the joys of fermentation! This one was like drinking the aroma of apricots, so powerfully so that I could have been convinced it contained natural or artificial stone fruit (it does not). It makes for a unique, if a little weak, milk coffee, but as a black coffee it’s easily the most interesting option in the market.

The best value

Lazzio Medium, 500g, $10.99 ($2.20 per 100g), available at Aldi

Score with milk: 5.5/10

Score black: 5/10

Excluding Jasper, which is a little harder to find than other coffees in this review, only 3.5 points separated the highest- and lowest-scoring milk coffees. The taste test was like reviewing local bus routes – everything sits in the four to six out of 10 range and any standouts were usually because of terrifying, rather than terrific, experiences. In a market like that, why wouldn’t you go for the cheapest option? This is a fine coffee. A little on the weak end, but horror-free.

Other notable options

Melitta Blue Mountain Style, 250g, $8 ($3.20 per 100g), available at Coles

Score black: 5.5/10

Sorting the judges’ comments and scores for this taste test was like watching a preschool gymnastics competition; whoever doesn’t fall over is immediately going to stand out. This coffee is the very definition of mid-range – neither robust nor weak in flavour and neither terrifying nor interesting in character. It did get some points for being a bit nutty or cereal-y in flavour and having at least an iota of acidity, but its best feature is price. It is cheaper than almost every other product, bested only by the supermarket homebrands and Delta Chicco D’Oro Premium Blend, a coffee that was described as “smelling like dry grass” and tasting like ash, cardboard and dirt. If you don’t live near an Aldi, this is the best-value option. If you’re a black coffee drinker, this is the best-value option period.

Score black: 5.5/10

During a normal industry cupping, coffee professionals will often include a checklist for whether a coffee is fruity, floral, earthy, nutty, vegetal and more. If we had judged based on this criteria, Oxfam would be one of only three coffees to pick up any points. The reviewers described it as fruity, earthy and tea-like – like an older, more rugged version of the Jasper roast.

The coffee experts tried to be professional with their reactions so as not to prejudice each other, but my inclination towards the dramatic and inability to stay silent for more than a minute completely ruined that. By the third round (a tasting of 26 cups of dark roasts), everyone was letting their true feelings be known, and never was that funnier than during a stretch of four samples including this, Lavazza Espresso Barista Intenso, Vittoria Coffee Italian Blend and Daley St Dark. It was a nonstop slideshow of face-contorting grimaces, creative swearing and sideways glances as if to say: “Prepare yourself, anxiety and torment await.” This and Lavazza were, in the reviewers’ opinions, the worst of the worst.

The lowest-scoring coffees all shared the same rough flavour profile, described by tasters as a combination of ash, dirt, burning rubber and old freezer – what should be an educational cocktail of flavours designed to question if this is really for human consumption. But, to be honest, I don’t think the specifics are an issue. When something is this unenjoyable, does it matter why? Would you rather drop your ice-cream or stub your toe? Who cares. Both experiences are preferable to accidentally calling your teacher “Mum”. The magnitude of unenjoyment is what matters, and both this and the Harris Strong we tasted were several magnitudes worse than many other coffees I never want to drink again.","Australian supermarket ground coffee taste test: we tried 41 varieties, two ways",lifestyle,Nicholas Jordan,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/24/australian-supermarket-ground-coffee-taste-test-ranking-41-varieties,2025-09-24 00:00:00,"A comprehensive taste test of 41 supermarket ground coffees reveals the best and worst options available.

"All suds, no substance: some laundry detergent sheets no better than water for stain removal, Choice study finds Several popular brands of laundry detergent sheets are little more effective – and in one case, less effective – than plain water in top loading washing machines, testing by consumer group Choice has found.

A relatively new form of detergent, laundry detergent sheets are usually advertised as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional forms of detergent such as powder and liquid, as they don’t contain single-use plastics.

“In principle, I don’t know why they shouldn’t be able to perform as well,” said Chris Barnes, who manages product testing reviews at Choice, and was involved in this year’s test of more than 50 laundry detergents – including powders, liquids, capsules and sheets. “I suspect they’re not actually delivering as much actual detergent in each dose.”

Choice tests detergents annually to find the best and worst products on shelves for front and top loading washing machines. A score above 70% for front loaders and above 60% for top loaders were what the experts recommended for an effective wash, as top loaders are generally less efficient at washing than front loaders. Front loaders have longer wash cycles, which means they’re able to wash the clothes more thoroughly, Barnes said.

For the second year in a row, Omo products cleaned up, taking out the first, second and third spots for front loaders. Omo powder scored 81%, followed by the Omo Ultimate 3 in 1 capsules and Omo Ultimate 3 in 1 Sensitive capsules with scores of 77% and 76% respectively.

Capsules, which tend to be the most expensive detergent category, were hit or miss for front loaders. The highest scoring capsule, the Omo Ultimate 3 in 1 Sensitive capsules, receiving 77% – at $1.29 a wash – but the lowest scoring capsule, Active Expert 3 in 1 laundry capsules, scored just 52%.

However, in front loaders and top loaders, laundry sheets ranked at the bottom of the list, performing little better than water. For top loaders, Skipper’s laundry detergent sheets scored 46% and Lucent Globe’s scored 45%. Restor’s Fresh Linen laundry detergent sheets scored 44%. Water alone was ranked at 45%.

Choice tested the detergents on stains including make-up, baby food, mud and grass and blood stains. Restor scored lower than water on blood stains by 2%.

A Restor spokesperson responded to the score, saying: “We have conducted extensive independent testing on Restor laundry detergent sheets, where the new formula demonstrated incredibly strong performance in both cleaning power and stain removal.

“[Blood] is a stain type that typically requires harsh chemicals to remove, and we deliberately avoid these because we don’t believe they belong in an everyday detergent, particularly for families and those with sensitive skin.”

A Skipper spokesperson said : “The testing focused on stain removal of specific soiling types, not whether the products remove oils and bacteria to keep clothes hygienic and fresh.”

“Comparing our sheets to plain water makes for a catchy headline, but it does not reflect their everyday utility in the household.”

Aldi’s Green Action laundry liquid concentrate was the next lowest non-sheet detergent for front loaders, scoring 45%. “We will investigate this allegation, however we are confident of our stringent processes in place that ensure our product quality meets and exceeds shoppers’ expectations,” an Aldi spokesperson said.

For top loaders, Aldi’s Trimat Advanced Laundry powder concentrate emerged as the most effective, with a score of 66%, beating Omo Powder Ultimate by one point.

While Omo’s top-scoring products cost upwards of $0.83 per wash, three products with scores between 71% and 74% cost less than $0.30 per wash: Active Expert laundry powder, Aldi’s Trimat Advanced laundry liquid concentrate and Coles’s Ultra Concentrate laundry powder.

Barnes said that a typical load of laundry for most consumers is not very dirty, so in those cases a mild or weak detergent will actually do the job.

“It’s encouraging that there is a good mix out there of really good performers, but also decent and cheap performers,” said Barnes.

“It is actually worth doing a little bit of homework just to see what the cost per wash is – it can be quite surprising.”

However, Barnes said buying a better washing machine might be a more sensible use of money than spending more on detergents.

“A large amount of the actual cleaning process … is actually done by the mechanical action of the machine itself,” he said.

“A good detergent will not make up the difference for a really terrible washing machine.”","All suds, no substance: some laundry detergent sheets no better than water for stain removal, Choice study finds",lifestyle,Isabella Lee,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/24/all-suds-no-substance-some-laundry-detergent-sheets-no-better-than-water-for-stain-removal-choice-study-finds,2025-09-24 00:00:00,"A study by consumer group Choice found that many laundry detergent sheets are only slightly more effective than water for stain removal, with some brands performing worse.

"What happens to your super after you retire? Your questions answered We spend our working lives building up our super. But it may not be until crunch time that we start thinking about what happens to it once we actually retire. What are the advantages of sticking with your fund in retirement? How much flexibility do you have? And what if you’re just dropping down to part-time work, rather than completely hanging up your hat?



To find out, we posed our burning questions to Craig Sankey, the head of risk and compliance at Industry Fund Services. Here’s what he had to say.

First things first. How much do I really need in super to retire?

It sounds like a simple question, but the answer is a little different for everyone. It’s important to take a step back and ask yourself a couple of questions before we get to a number. What age are you looking to retire? Because if you want to retire at 60, you’re going to need a lot more money than if you’re going to retire at 67. And how much do you want to live on each year? Some people are happy to live on $40,000 a year, while others want $100,000.

So you’ve got to answer those two questions first, and then we can come up with that number. I recommend playing around with a super retirement calculator, which can help you work out what’s right for you.

What happens to my super account when I retire? Do I cash out and ride off into the sunset?

Many years ago, that was the common scenario for a lot of people. But these days, while you still have the option of cashing it out (and it’s still fairly common for people to cash out some super to pay out their mortgage or go on a big holiday), what’s becoming far more common is using most of your super to provide an income stream. That way, you’ll get paid a monthly income, designed to replace the paycheck that came in regularly throughout your working life.

What is an industry super fund, how do I know if I’m with one, and why should I stick with one through retirement?

You know the “compare the pair” ads, which feature people holding their hands up in the shape of a diamond? That’s the symbol to look for. If your fund has one, you’re in an industry super fund.

So what is an industry super fund? Well, it’s a fund that’s run just for members. There’s no profit that has to be paid to owners; there are no dividends that have to be paid to shareholders. It’s a model that’s worked really well for members – industry super funds have generally performed very well in terms of performance and low fees. They also offer a range of options and support to help you through retirement.

If I’m no longer contributing money to super, could my balance still grow in retirement?

Yes. If you don’t convert your money to an income stream, as long as the markets remain positive, your money will still compound.

It’s also possible your balance could go up even if you do convert your super into an income stream. If you drew, say, 5% of your account balance out over the next 12 months, but your fund returned 6% that year, the return is still greater than what you’re withdrawing.

Nice! How much flexibility do I have with my super fund in retirement? Can I take out a lump sum for a holiday or a new car?

Yep! These days, there is a lot more flexibility in retirement. The most popular and flexible type of retirement income scheme is called an account-based pension, which nearly every super fund offers these days. With these, you receive regular income, but you can also make withdrawals at any time to meet whatever expenditure might pop up.

I’m switching from full-time to part-time or freelance work, rather than flat-out retiring. Can I still access my super?

You sure can. Once you’re 60, you can commence what’s called a transition to retirement pension. This allows you to draw down up to 10% of your super account balance each year, tax free. It’s perfect for topping up your income, and it was specifically designed for people transitioning from full-time to part-time work.

I’ve got more questions. How can I get expert advice about my superannuation?

Not many people know this, but since 2022 it’s been legislated that super funds have to help their members prepare for retirement.

The funds are really eager to do this, so most now offer personalised financial advice as part of your membership fee. If it’s fairly simple advice you’re after, you may not have to pay any additional fees to access it; for more comprehensive advice, there may be a charge. But you should definitely contact your fund to find out more.

"Five ways to wear visible socks: coordinate with your shoes or add a zing of colour I’d argue that the hardest-working, most undervalued pieces in our wardrobes are our socks. They bear the brunt of our daily toil yet rarely receive praise or acknowledgment. Our toe coverings deserve some sartorial consideration – it’s the least we can do.

Despite their bland ubiquity, socks have been pulled into many cultural quarrels. It was only recently that people labelled ankle socks as millennial-coded and crew socks as gen Z-coded (because the height of your sock translates directly to your age bracket).

We’ve also been privy to a turning of the tides when it comes to “fun” socks (the patterned and colourful pairs sporting avocados or dogs found on corporate ankles or in Father’s Day targeted ads) and the declining popularity of “no-show” socks, the teeny, ever-slipping socks you wear to make it look like you’re not wearing socks.

Socks see us through thick and thin. And we see them go from thick to thin. They shouldn’t be an afterthought when it comes to assembling an outfit, but a crucial part of its foundation. Here’s how I styled visible socks for a week.

Office outfit: day one

View image in fullscreen Pants that cut off at the ankles allow your socks to shine

In this in-between Melbourne weather, where spring is playing hide-and-seek, I’ve been wearing button-up shirts paired with pants and a medium-weight jacket – something halfway between a thin cardigan and a puffer jacket. This pair of lantern pants (from LA brand No Less Than) is on high rotation. It cuts off above my ankles, allowing a pair of statement socks to shine.

View image in fullscreen Houndstooth socks lend outfits a vintage feel

I’ve owned these red houndstooth woollen socks for longer than recommended, but I adore their instant vintage injection into any outfit. They’re peeping out from my pair of Sneaky Janes (from local brand Twoobs) that would probably look more in place on the feet of a geriatric lifeguard.

Office: day two

View image in fullscreen An equestrian-inspired sliver of sock helps break up an otherwise dark outfit

Visible socks don’t have to be loud; they can whisper over the tops of boots. The sliver of white here helps break up an otherwise dark outfit. For a day in the office followed by a show at Comedy theatre, I wore an op-shopped button-up shirt and knitted vest by Melbourne maker By Hanan, with a secondhand knitted skirt featuring a leg cut-out. (Sorry if this breaks your workplace’s dress code – the dress codes in predominantly millennial creative workplaces like my office don’t really exist.) Equestrians and their riding boots inspired this combination of Radical Yes boots and long white socks. Giddy-up.

Weekend: day one

For those foraying into the world of sock styling for the first time, might I suggest matching your socks to your shoes? I’ve embraced being matchy-matchy here, with light-blue Paire socks and Radical Yes suede shoes.

View image in fullscreen Complementary shades work well with colour-matched socks

A sock-and-shoe combo can be a cohesive added layer to an outfit; you don’t have to commit to a top-to-toe colour-coordinated look. Instead, try complementary or analogous colours. My khaki Kowtow sweater and op-shopped dark teal skirt nicely contrast against the baby blue.

Weekend: day two

View image in fullscreen Socks can add a zing of colour to an otherwise muted outfit

Most of my sock collection leans pretty neutral. True to my generation, I’m commonly found in a pair of white crew socks. But there are a few bolder pairs I am particularly fond of. I got these cobalt blue ones from an op-shop’s new, donated stock section. My outfit – an oversized Ganni sweater and op-shopped checkered skirt – relies on a muted, warm palette. The zing of blue freshens it up. If in doubt, add something unexpected. If in further doubt, stick to something block-coloured.

View image in fullscreen Mesh socks have become a popular street style accessory at fashion weeks lately

Socks aren’t purely functional; depending on their length and material they can also be used as an accessory to switch up the overall look of an outfit, the same way you might use a scarf, belt or brooch. Case in point, black mesh socks (no, they’re not compression socks) can be paired with dressy shoes such as heels or loafers, a look that has been quite popular at fashion weeks in New York and Copenhagen.

"Kylie Kwong, Bruce Pascoe and Aunty Beryl Van-Oploo head the first Australian Native Food festival Sharon Winsor has spent 30 years sharing her knowledge of native Australian food. Her business Indigiearth sells lemon myrtle, salted dukkah and bush tomatoes, and she regularly hosts native dining events in Mudgee and Sydney. This month, she’s presenting a first-of-its-kind Australian Native Food festival at Sydney’s Carriageworks.

The festival has been a labour of love for the Ngemba Weilwan woman, who first presented the idea to Carriageworks five years ago.

“They loved the idea and we were actually going to do it back then, but obviously the year that Covid hit it got pushed to the side like most things did,” Winsor says.

More than 20 First Nations vendors will have market stalls at the festival, alongside chef demonstrations from well-known culinary figures including Kylie Kwong, Bruce Pascoe and Ben Shewry, as well as weaving workshops run by Ngumpie Weaving.

View image in fullscreen Indigiearth founder Sharon Winsor. Photograph: Indigiearth

Winsor says she has always wanted to do something like this to celebrate native foods, “to give back to my people and culture … and to support the industry on a bigger scale”.

She says it can be challenging to find venues willing to host an event this size. When conceiving of the festival, she initially approached a number of other people and places, and found “not everyone understands our vision or sees or believes in what we do as blackfellas”.

“Sometimes we just have to back ourselves and go ahead with it,” she says.

To program the festival, Winsor reached out to “people [who have] built their careers using native ingredients and to people I’ve worked with and know in the industry,” she says. This time, she did not get knocked back – everyone she reached out to said “absolutely – we’re there”.

The festival runs on 27 and 28 September, with workshops and demonstrations both days. Aunty Beryl Van-Oploo, an elder and native ingredient master who founded the Indigenous catering company Yaama Barrgay, will give a demonstration with Kwong on the Saturday, and Gomeroi/Guumbraay woman Kerrie Saunders will join Pascoe for a demonstration on Sunday.

“I wanted to be able to bring in people like Kerrie Saunders and Raylene Brown [founder of Kungkas Can Cook] from Alice because they’re women I’ve known for a very long time and who’ve done so much hard work in the industry,” Winsor says.

The event is an opportunity for Winsor to show the industry “that we are still here” and “our women who’ve grown up black, they’ve done the hard yards, they’re our grassroots and they don’t get the opportunities they deserve”.

View image in fullscreen There’ll be more than 20 market stalls by First Nations businesses. Photograph: Indigiearth

Some of the festival’s events are ticketed, but many aspects will be free and open to the public. There will be a diverse range of native Australian foods for sale, alongside native plants that visitors can take home from the festival’s nursery. Indigiearth is also running a pop-up cafe, serving dishes such as oysters with green ants and finger lime pearls.

“I specifically curated this event to happen in September because it’s a new season for us and that new beginning, new ceremony, new life cycle,” Winsor says. It’s a good time to try lemon myrtle, which is in season, “but there’s plenty of wattleseed at the moment and plenty of quandong fruit around too,” she says.

When Winsor established her native food business three decades ago, she navigated many misconceptions about bushfoods. “It’s much more than just an ingredient on a plate,” she says. “People don’t realise that it’s medicine, that we’ve got over 6,000 edible native species, that connects us to so much more.”","Kylie Kwong, Bruce Pascoe and Aunty Beryl Van-Oploo head the first Australian Native Food festival",lifestyle,Eelemarni Close-Brown,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/23/australian-native-food-festival-kylie-kwong-bruce-pascoe-aunty-beryl-van-oploo,2025-09-23 00:00:00,"Sharon Winsor is organizing the first Australian Native Food festival at Sydney's Carriageworks, featuring over 20 First Nations vendors and renowned chefs like Kylie Kwong.

"The kindness of strangers: a man let me share his hotel room when I was locked out in Paris The day hadn’t got off to a great start. I was flying back to France from the UK after a friend’s funeral. I’d been living in Paris doing a French-language course and living with a host family who, to be honest, weren’t particularly welcoming.

It was late at night when I got back to the apartment, only to find the entrance code to the building had changed – something the host family had neglected to mention. They must have already been in bed, because nobody was answering my calls. Short of throwing rocks at the fourth-floor window to wake them up, I had no way of getting inside.

I was stuck wandering around Paris with my suitcase, wondering what to do now. I rang my girlfriend back in the UK to ask if she might be able to book me a hotel online – this was before smartphones. She had a look, but everywhere was €350 a night or more, which was crazy money for a young student and absolutely out of my budget.

At this point I was feeling stuck, hopeless – and quite hungry. I wandered over to a McDonald’s and the staff there clearly realised something was not going well for me, so they offered me a couple of burgers for free as they were closing up.

I wandered over to sit on a bench and eat my Big Macs when a guy came over to me and started speaking in broken French. He clearly wasn’t a local, so I switched to English and, sure enough, he was a Brit just like me. He asked me for directions to the McDonald’s and I told him it was just down the road, but that he was out of luck as they had just closed for the night.

He started walking away but I yelled out that they’d given me more food than I could eat, if he would like one of my burgers?

He accepted my offer and sat down on the park bench to eat with me. We got chatting and I told him my story about not being able to get into my apartment, while he told me he was an executive at a big bank, here on a work-funded trip. He said: “Don’t take this as a weird offer or anything, but I can see you’re in a tight spot – do you want to sleep on my hotel room floor?”

I was a little hesitant and initially declined. But chewing over the fact that I had nowhere else to go, I called my girlfriend for advice. She had a conversation with this man over the phone and we decided the safer course of action was to take up the offer, rather than spend the night on the street. He slept in the bed, and I slept on the floor of his five-star hotel, which was actually quite comfortable.

That man rescued me from unfortunate circumstances and I came away reminded that people can be good to each other. All he gained from that offer was the knowledge that he’d helped someone else. And a free burger, I suppose – but he was going to get that anyway.
